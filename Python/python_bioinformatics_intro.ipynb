    "\n",
    "This notebook was originally written by [Marc Cohen](https://github.com/mco-gh), an engineer at Google. The original source can be found on [Marc's short link service](https://mco.fyi/), and starts with [Python lesson 0](https://mco.fyi/py0), and I encourage you to work through that notebook if you find some details missing here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rob Edwards edited the notebook, adapted it for bioinformatics, using some simple geneticy examples, condensed it into a single notebook, and rearranged some of the lessons, so if some of it does not make sense, it is Rob's fault!\n",
    "\n",
    "It is intended as a hands-on companion to an in-person course, and if you would like Rob to teach this course (or one of the other courses) don't hesitate to get in touch with him.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using this notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "You can download the original version of this notebook from [GitHub](https://linsalrob.github.io/ComputationalGenomicsManual/Python/python_bioinformatics_intro.ipynb) and from [Rob's Google Drive]()\n",
    "\n",
    "**You should make your own copy of this notebook by selecting File->Save a copy in Drive from the menu bar above, and then you can edit the code and run it as your own**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several lessons, and you can do them in any order. I've tried to organise them in the order I think most appropriate, but you may disagree!\n"

You should avoid short names (one or two letters), however, you might also want to avoid using `rna_sequence_coverage_averaged_by_gene_length`, which even though it is valid, it will be a pain to type everytime (and make your code look ugly!)\n"

    "**When in doubt, use parentheses.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Coders make liberal use of parentheses because:\n",
    "* You don't need to remember the precedence rules.\n",
    "* You don't have to worry about surprises.\n",
    "* It makes code more readable.\n",
    "* It eliminates any ambiguity\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we could write this expression, which evaluates `A and B` first, then `C and D`, and finally takes the boolean `or` of the two preceding results:\n",
    "\n",
    "`A and B or C and D`\n",
    "\n",
    "but we much prefer to make explicit, like this so we don't have to _think_ (about precedence rules) every time we look at this code:\n",

    "## F-strings\n",
    "\n",
    "We often need to combine variables, values, and strings. For example, if we have the following variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `bacteria_name`\n",
    "- `genome_size`\n",
    "\n",
    "we might want to print a report, where each line summarizes the values above. We could do that like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "print(\"bacteria: \", bacteria_name, \", genome size: \", genome_size, \" bp\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "which produces this output:\n",
    "```\n",
    "bacteria: E. coli genome size: 4500000 bp\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This sort of construct gets a bit tedious. Plus the space between the customer id and the following comma unintended and undesirable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has a simple approach, called f-strings, that offer a more readable solution to this problem. If you prefix a string with the character `f`, it gives the string magic powers. Specifically, the sting has the ability to **interpolate** variables inside curly brackets. Here's how we could express the previous `print` statement using an f-string:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "print(f\"bacteria: {bacteria_name}, genome size: {genome_size} bp\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is shorter, less tedious, easier to read and write, and solves the formatting issue related to the comma between the two fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that you can put any Python code inside the curly braces, so this technique is very powerful. Once you get going with Python, you'll find all sort of wonderful ways to use f-strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also a neat trick that can help with large numbers! Adding a `:,` after a number means `automatically insert thousands separators`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "print(f\"bacteria: {bacteria_name}, genome size: {genome_size:,} bp\")\n",
