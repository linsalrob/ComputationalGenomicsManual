    "## About this notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook was originally written by [Marc Cohen](https://github.com/mco-gh), an engineer at Google. The original source can be found on [Marc's short link service](https://mco.fyi/), and starts with [Python lesson 0](https://mco.fyi/py0), and I encourage you to work through that notebook if you find some details missing here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rob Edwards edited the notebook, adapted it for bioinformatics, using some simple geneticy examples, condensed it into a single notebook, and rearranged some of the lessons, so if some of it does not make sense, it is Rob's fault!\n",
    "\n",
    "It is intended as a hands-on companion to an in-person course, and if you would like Rob to teach this course (or one of the other courses) don't hesitate to get in touch with him.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using this notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "You can download the original version of this notebook from [GitHub](https://linsalrob.github.io/ComputationalGenomicsManual/Python/Python_Lesson_5.ipynb) and from [Rob's Google Drive]()\n",
    "\n",
    "**You should make your own copy of this notebook by selecting File->Save a copy in Drive from the menu bar above, and then you can edit the code and run it as your own**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several lessons, and you can do them in any order. I've tried to organise them in the order I think most appropriate, but you may disagree!\n"
