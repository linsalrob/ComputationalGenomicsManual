    "Python has a simple approach, called f-strings, that offer a more readable solution to this problem. If you prefix a string with the character `f`, it gives the string magic powers. Specifically, the sting has the ability to **interpolate** variables inside curly brackets. Here's how we could express the previous `print` statement using an f-string:\n",
