SRP004848	Population genomics and local adaptation in wild isolates of a model microbial eukaryote	Elucidating the connection between genotype, phenotype and adaptation in wild populations is fundamental to the study of evolutionary biology, yet it remains an elusive goal, particularly for microscopic taxa, which comprise the majority of life. Even for microbes that can be reliably found in the wild, defining the boundaries of their populations and discovering ecologically relevant phenotypes has proved extremely difficult. Here, we have circumvented these issues in the microbial eukaryote Neurospora crassa by utilizing a â€œreverse-ecologyâ€ population genomic approach that is free of a priori assumptions about candidate adaptive alleles. We performed Illumina whole-transcriptome sequencing of 48 individuals to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms. From these data, we discovered two cryptic and recently diverged populations, one in the tropical Caribbean basin and the other endemic to subtropical Louisiana. We conducted high-resolution scans for chromosomal regions of extreme divergence between these populations and found two such genomic â€œislands.â€ Through growth-rate assays, we found that the subtropical Louisiana population has a higher fitness at low temperature (10Â°C) and that several of the genes within these distinct regions have functions related to the response to cold temperature. These results suggest the divergence islands may be the result of local adaptation to the 9Â°C difference in average yearly minimum temperature between these two populations. Remarkably, another of the genes identified using this unbiased, whole-genome approach is the well-known circadian oscillator frequency, suggesting that the 2.4Â° â€“ 10.6Â° difference in latitude between the populations may be another important environmental parameter.

SRP006764	DIPP Diabetes Microbiome	Recent studies have suggested a bacterial role in the development of autoimmune disorders including type 1 diabetes (T1D). Over 30 billion nucleotide bases of Illumina shotgun metagenomic data were analyzed from stool samples collected from four pairs of matched T1D case-control subjects collected at the time of the development of T1D associated autoimmunity (i.e., autoantibodies). From these, approximately one million open reading frames were predicted and compared to the SEED protein database. Of the 3,849 functions identified in these samples, 144 and 797 were statistically more prevalent in cases and controls, respectively. Genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism, adhesions, motility, phages, prophages, sulfur metabolism, and stress responses were more abundant in cases while genes with roles in DNA and protein metabolism, aerobic respiration, and amino acid synthesis were more common in controls. These data suggest that increased adhesion and flagella synthesis in autoimmune subjects may be involved in triggering a T1D associated autoimmune response. Extensive differences in metabolic potential indicate that autoimmune subjects have a functionally aberrant microbiome. Mining 16S rRNA data from these datasets showed a higher proportion of butyrate-producing and mucin-degrading bacteria in controls compared to cases, while those bacteria that produce short chain fatty acids other than butyrate were higher in cases. Thus, a key rate-limiting step in butyrate synthesis is more abundant in controls. These data suggest that a consortium of lactate- and butyrate-producing bacteria in a healthy gut induce a sufficient amount of mucin synthesis to maintain gut integrity. In contrast, non-butyrate-producing lactate-utilizing bacteria prevent optimal mucin synthesis, as identified in autoimmune subjects.

ERP007116	Metagenomic approach to examine respiratory samples from children with lower respiratory tract infections	Viruses are the most frequent cause of respiratory disease in children. However, despite the advanced diagnostic methods currently in use, in 20 to 50% of respiratory samples a specific pathogen cannot be detected. This observation has led investigators to wonder if novel respiratory viruses are still to be discovered. In this work, we used a metagenomic approach to examine respiratory samples from  children that required hospital admission due to lower respiratory tract infections (pneumonia) in six hospitals, located in four cities of different states of Mexico. The samples  had been previously found negative for 6 bacteria and 15 respiratory viruses by PCR.  DNA reads for at least one virus commonly associated to respiratory infections was found in 20 of 25 hospitalized patients, while reads for pathogenic respiratory bacteria were detected in the remaining 5 children. Respiratory syncytial virus, coronavirus-OC43, and rhinovirus were identified as well as  less frequently viruses associated to respiratory infections as  anellovirus, rotavirus, astrovirus, sevelal  animal and plant viruses. No novel viruses were identified.	ERR649075,ERR649076,ERR649099

ERP010550	Integrated microbiome and host profiling in a mouse model of colitis suggests host immune activity drives changes in the gut micro-environment that influence both microbial community structure and gene expression	The gut microbiome is significantly altered in inflammatory bowel diseases, but the basis of these changes is not well understood. We have combined metagenomic and metatranscriptomic profiling of the gut microbiome to assess changes to both bacterial community structure and transcriptional activity in a mouse model of colitis. Gene families involved in microbial resistance to oxidative stress, including Dps/ferritin, Fe-dependent peroxidase and glutathione S-transferase, were transcriptionally up-regulated in colitis, implicating a role for increased oxygen tension in gut microbiota modulation. Transcriptional profiling of the host gut tissue and host RNA in the gut lumen revealed a marked increase in the transcription of genes with an activated macrophage and granulocyte signature, suggesting the involvement of these cell types in influencing microbial gene expression. Down-regulation of host glycosylation genes further supports a role for inflammation-driven changes to the gut niche that may impact the microbiome. We propose that members of the bacterial community react to inflammation-associated increased oxygen tension by inducing genes involved in oxidative stress resistance. Furthermore, correlated transcriptional responses between host glycosylation and bacterial glycan utilisation support a role for altered usage of host-derived carbohydrates in colitis.

ERP013107	Metagenomic analysis of microbial CpG methylation in Delaware estuarine riverbank sediment	Marine sediments harbor a vast amount of Earthâ€™s microbial biomass, yet little is understood regarding how cells subsist in these low-energy environments without forming endospores. DNA methylation, a reversible process that involves the addition of a methyl group to a nucleotide base via a methyltransferase, exists as a possible epigenetic mechanism for non-sporulated cells in low-energy sediment environments to regulate gene expression and potentially lower cellular activity. To investigate the presence and scope of this phenomenon in estuarine sediment microbial communities, we sequenced three metagenomic and 16S rRNA gene amplicon libraries extracted from a sediment core collected from the banks of the Oyster Rocks site of the Broadkill River, Milton, Delaware, USA. We targeted 5-methylcytosine at CpG sites by digesting metagenomic libraries with the methylation-sensitive restriction endonuclease HpaII. By quantitatively distinguishing â€œmixedâ€ methylation states for populations of CpG site copies, we identified dynamic, non-binary shifts in CpG methylation for community taxa and function.

SRP074153	Metagenomes from 11 human infant fecal samples hospitalized in the same intensive care unit	Bacteria that persist in hospitals can contribute to the establishment of the microbiome in newborns and the spread of hospital-acquired diseases. Yet we know little about microbial communities in hospitals, or about the extent to which persistent vs. recently immigrated bacterial strains establish in the gastrointestinal tracts of hospitalized individuals.In combination with BioProject PRJNA273761 (10 infants / 55 samples) we analyzed strain-resolved genomes obtained from a total of 202 samples collected over a three-year period from 21 infants hospitalized in the same intensive care unit.Strains were rarely shared, consistent with prior analysis of a subset of these data. Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus epidermidis, common gut colonists, exhibit diversity comparable to that of NCBI reference strains, suggesting no recent common ancestor for all populations in this hospital setting. Thus, we infer multiple introduction events for these species. Despite the rarity of shared strains, strains of five species exhibiting a degree of sequence variation consistent with in situ diversification were identified in different infants hospitalized three years apart. Three were also detected in multiple infants in the same year, suggesting that these strains are unusually widely dispersed and persistent in the hospital environment. Persistent strains were not significantly different from non-persistent strains with regards to pathogenicity potential including antibiotic resistance. Notably, non-identical siblings had multiple abundant strains in common, even 30 days after birth and antibiotic administration, suggesting overlapping strain sources and/or genetic selection. Our approach can be used in order to study microbial dynamics in hospitals and provides an important step towards directing health-promoting colonization in hospitalized individuals.

This study used metagenomic methods (community genomic analysis and sequencing of amplified 16S rRNA genes) to document microbial colonization of the gut of a premature infant born at 28 weeks gestation. Analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences collected approximately daily revealed three compositional phases during colonization. We reconstructed genomes of the dominant organisms and intensively curated population genomic datasets from the third phase. In the third phase, the communities were dominated by a nearly clonal Serratia population, two Citrobacter strains sharing >99% nucleotide identity, and contained a lower abundance Enterococcus population, multiple plasmids and bacteriophage. The relative abundance of the Citrobacter strains changed significantly over time. Modeling of Citrobacter strain abundances suggests differences in growth rates and/or host colonization patterns. We identified genotypic variation potentially responsible for divergent strain ecologies, including hotspots of sequence variation in regulatory genes and intergenic regions, and in genes involved in transport, flagellar biosynthesis, substrate metabolism, and host colonization, as well as differences in the complements of these genes. Our results demonstrate that a community genomic approach can elucidate gut microbial colonization at the resolution required to discern medically relevant strain and species population dynamics, and hence improve our ability to diagnose and treat microbial community-mediated disorders.

ERP003855	Autologous antibody capture to enrich immunogenic viruses for viral discovery	Discovery of new viruses has been boosted by novel deep sequencing technologies. Currently, many viruses can be identified by sequencing without knowledge of the pathogenicity of the virus. However, attributing the presence of a virus in patient material to a disease in the patient can be a challenge. One approach to meet this challenge is identification of viral sequences based on enrichment by autologous patient antibody capture. This method facilitates identification of viruses that have provoked an immune response within the patient and may increase the sensitivity of the current virus discovery techniques. To demonstrate the utility of this method, virus discovery deep sequencing (VIDISCA-454) was performed on clinical samples from 19 patients: 13 with a known respiratory viral infection and 6 with a known gastrointestinal viral infection. Patient sera was collected from one to several months after the acute infection phase. Input and antibody capture material was sequenced and enrichment was assessed. In 18 of the 19 patients, viral reads from immunogenic viruses were enriched by antibody capture (ranging between 1.5x to 343x in respiratory material, and 1.4x to 53x in stool). Enriched reads were also determined in an identity independent manner by using a novel algorithm Xcompare. In 16 of the 19 patients, 21% to 100% of the enriched reads were derived from immunogenic viruses. In conclusion, the technique provides a novel approach to specifically identify immunogenic viral sequences among the bulk of sequences which are usually encountered during virus discovery metagenomics.

SRP062720	The vaginal microbiome in HIV positive and negative women sampled at two Chicago hospitals	HIV infection can cause immune deficiency and allow opportunistic infections, and, conversely, disruption of the normal human microbiota can be associated with inflammation, potentially promoting HIV transmission and replication.  In this study we investigated the associations among HIV infection, the vaginal microbiota, and socioeconomic status by comparing vaginal microbiome samples from a large cohort (n=319) from two different US hospitals serving different socioeconomic groups. Within each hospital, we compared HIV+ and HIV- women.  We found that rates of bacterial vaginosis, as measured by Nugent score, were higher in the hospital serving the less affluent community, and Nugent scores were also higher among HIV+ women. Higher Nugent scores correlated with higher bacterial diversity and lower colonization with Lactobacillus, as seen in previous studies. HIV status had only modest associations with microbiota measures-HIV+ status was weakly associated with increased diversity and increased proportions of pro-inflammatory genera.  In previous work, some though not all comparative studies of vaginal microbiota sampled in US versus African hospitals have shown more extreme differences.  Evidently effects of socioeconomic level or HIV infection status on women's health at the hospitals studied here were not great enough to result in large differences in the vaginal microbiota.

These sediments were sampled from deep within the dark cave where there is no known source of introduced organic carbon. Dark ice caves such as Warren Cave exemplify an environment where the input of plant and other photosynthetic-derived organic carbon is minimal and thus provides an environment at the extreme low end of the spectrum for carbon concentration. Under these conditions microbes will be forced to scavenge any and all energy sources available, including gases and inorganic compounds found in the rock.	SRR1572169

Employing high throughput 16S rRNA gene tag sequencing, CARD-FISH, and targeted metagenomics, we found a distinct microbial community directly adjacent to the venting orifices dominated by chemolithoautotrophic bacteria. This community is enriched in Alpha- and Gammaproteobacteria with versatile heterotrophic potential. We propose that hotspots of chemolithoautotrophic life support a â€œbeltâ€ of heterotrophic bacteria which differ significantly from the oligotrophic microbiota of the deep sea.

ERP017163	Microbial succession and flavour production in the fermented dairy beverage kefir	Kefir is a putatively health-promoting dairy beverage that is produced when a kefir grain, consisting of a consortium of microorganisms, is added to milk to initiate a natural fermentation. Here, a detailed analysis was carried out to determine how the microbial population, gene content and flavour of three kefirs from distinct geographical locations change over the course of 24-hour-fermentations. Metagenomic sequencing revealed that Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens was the dominant bacterial species in kefir during early stages of fermentations, but that Leuconostoc mesenteroides became more prevalent in later stages. This pattern is consistent with an observation that genes involved in aromatic amino acid biosynthesis were absent from Lb. kefiranofaciens, but were present in L. mesenteroides. Additionally, these shifts in the microbial community structure, and associated pathways, corresponded to changes in the levels of volatile compounds. Specifically,  Acetobacter spp. correlated with acetic acid, Lactobacillus spp. correlated with carboxylic acids, esters and ketones, Leuconostoc spp. correlated with acetic acid and 2,3-butanedione, and Saccharomyces spp. correlated with esters. The correlation data suggest a causal relationship between microbial taxa and flavour which is supported by observations that addition of Lb. kefiranofaciens NCFB 2797 increased the levels of esters and ketones, whereas addition of L. mesenteroides 213M0 increased acetic acid and 2,3-butanedione. Finally, we detected genes associated with probiotic functionalities in the kefir microbiome.  Our results illustrate the dynamic nature of kefir fermentations and microbial succession patterns therein, and can be applied to optimise fermentation processes, flavours and health-related attributes of this and other fermented foods.

ERP015217	Progression of the bronchoalveolar lavage microbiome and disease markers in pre-school children with Cystic Fibrosis	A polymicrobial infection with well-known pathogens characterizes established CF lung disease. Few data describe lower airway infection in pre-school CF children. We hypothesize that aspiration of oral flora shapes the CF lung microbiome with subsequent emergence of established pathogens, and these changes in microbial composition are associated with airways inflammation and structural disease. Microbial characterisation using 16S DNA sequencing was performed in 53 right middle lobe bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples obtained from 46 children ages 3-60 months undergoing CT and BAL as part of the Australian Respiratory Early Surveillance Team. Twenty-three genera, with an abundance of =0.5%, clustered into environmental, oral, and defined-pathogenic bacteria. Children <2 years exhibited predominantly environmental and oral bacterial clusters whereas older children exhibited pathogens. Clinical phenotypes differed depending on the dominant bacterial cluster-those dominated by environmental taxa showed least and those with pathogens most inflammation and CT-changes. Bacterial richness and diversity decreased across the three clusters. Subjects with prior BAL documented pathogens revealed negative associations of bacterial richness and diversity with markers of lung disease. The microbial community in early CF is highly diverse and shaped by oral flora in the presence of structural lung disease. Subsequent pathogen acquisition is associated with decreased diversity and increased inflammation.	ERR1368624,ERR1368626

Although the specimen contains small amounts of human DNA, we use an enrichment strategy to isolate sites that are informative about its relationship to Neanderthals and present-day humans. We find that on the order of six to nine percent of the genome of the Oase individual is derived from Neanderthals, more than any other modern human sequenced to date. Three chromosomal segments of Neanderthal ancestry are over 50 centimorgans in size, indicating that this individual had a Neanderthal ancestor as recently as four to six generations back. However, the Oase individual does not share more alleles with later Europeans than with East Asians, suggesting that the Oase population did not contribute substantially to later humans in Europe.

ERP005883	Effects of cholera on the human gut microbiota, and interactions between human gut microbes and Vibrio cholerae.	Given the global burden of diarrheal diseases, it is important to understand how members of the gut microbiota affect the risk for, the course of, and recovery from disease.  This is true for young children when the gut microbiota is being assembled, as well as for adults.  Recent culture-independent analyses of the fecal microbiota of healthy Bangladeshi infants and children, sampled monthly from birth through the second year of life, have identified a group of age-discriminatory bacterial taxa that together define a normal program of postnatal development (maturation) of the gut microbiota. The acute voluminous diarrhea caused by Vibrio cholerae represents a dramatic example of enteropathogen invasion and gut microbial community disruption.  We have conducted a detailed time-series metagenomic study of the fecal microbiota during the acute diarrheal and recovery phases of cholera in a cohort of Bangladeshi adults living in an area with a very high burden of disease. Recovery is characterized by a pattern of accumulation of bacterial taxa that mirrors the normal pattern of assembly/maturation of the microbiota in healthy Bangladeshi children. To define underlying mechanisms, we created an artificial community of 14 sequenced human gut bacterial species in gnotobiotic mice, composed of taxa that directly correlate with recovery from cholera and that are indicative of normal microbiota maturation in healthy Bangladeshi children. One of these age-discriminatory species, Ruminococcus obeum, exhibited consistent increases in its relative abundance upon V. cholerae infection of the mice. Follow-up mono- and bi-colonization studies established that R. obeum restricts V. cholerae colonization. RNA-Seq of the communityâ€™s meta-transcriptome, combined with assays of autoinducer-2 (AI-2) production and function, revealed that expression of R. obeum luxS (AI-2 synthase) and AI-2 production increase significantly with V. cholerae invasion, and that R. obeum AI-2 causes quorum-sensing mediated repression of toxin co-regulated pilus, a primary V. cholerae colonization factor. Co-colonization experiments in gnotobiotic mice established that R. obeum AI-2 reduces Vibrio colonization/pathogenicity through a novel pathway that does not depend on the canonical V. cholerae AI-2 sensor, LuxP.

ERP020766	Mouse_gut_microbiota_transmission_study	Homozygosity for FUT2 ((1,2) fucosyltransferase) null alleles determines the lack of (1,2)fucosylated glycans in the gastrointestinal tract epithelia and secretions. 20% of people of European, Asian and African descent do not present fucose on their mucosae and secretions due to homozygosity for FUT2 null alleles and thus are called non secretors. Non secretors are more susceptible to various diseases like Crohnâ€™s disease, ulcerative colitis and type I diabetes and gut microbiota composition seems to be involved in the onset of these non-communicable diseases. FUT2-deficent mice represent a murine model of human non secretor status. We are studying gut microbiota of wt and FUT2 ko mice composition, its transmission to the offspring and genotype-associated changes. 16s libraries from gut microbiome extracted from mouse faecal samples will be generated and sequenced on MiSeq platform.

SRP064428	Single diatom like particles Metagenome	Bacterial colonization of living and dead particles is central to the functioning of freshwater ecosystems. While studies on such colonization are typically based on bulk analysis, only a few have tried to reveal interactions and population linkages at the biologically relevant scale of individual particles. We used next generation sequencing of the bacterial 16SrRNA gene to characterize bacterial communities attached to individual diatom cells and other particles of similar size (phytoplankton and macrophyte debris) in Lake Erken, Sweden. We compared the diatom-attached communities with the reported typical freshwater community, and used co-occurrence network analysis to uncover intrapopulation interactions on the microscopic particles and linkages between specific diatoms and the associated bacterial communities. Our study demonstrates that bacterial communities attached to the particles differ strongly in composition as compared to the typical free-living bacterioplankton and further demonstrate that the composition of bacterial communities colonizing individual phytoplankton cells are not shaped by the specific diatom species. Instead, the data suggest that associations and dependencies within the colonizing community determine their respective composition.	SRR2551121,SRR2551122,SRR2551124

ERP013093	Brain meta-transcriptomics from harbor seals to infer the role of the microbiome and virome in a stranding event	Marine diseases are becoming more frequent, and tools for identifying pathogens and disease reservoirs are needed to help prevent and mitigate epizootics. Meta-transcriptomics provides insights into disease etiology by cataloguing and comparing sequences from suspected pathogens. This method is a powerful approach to simultaneously evaluate both the viral and bacterial communities, but few studies haveÂ applied this technique in marine systems.Â In 2009 seven harbor seals,Â Phoca vitulina,Â stranded along the California coast from a similar brain disease ofÂ unknown cause of death (UCD). We evaluated the differences between the virome and microbiome of UCDs and harbor seals with known causes of death. Here we determined that UCD stranded animals had no viruses in their brain tissue. However, in the bacterial community, we identifiedÂ BurkholderiaÂ andÂ Coxiella burnetiiÂ as important pathogens associated with this stranding event.Â BurkholderiaÂ were 100% prevalent and ~2.8 log2 fold more abundant in the UCD animals. Further, whileÂ C. burnetiiÂ was found in only 35.7% of all samples, it was highly abundant (~94% of the total microbial community) in a single individual. In this harbor seal, C. burnetiiÂ showed high transcription rates of invading and translation genes, implicating it in the pathogenesis of this animal. Based on these data we propose thatÂ BurkholderiaÂ taxa andÂ C. burnetiiÂ are potentially important opportunistic neurotropic pathogens in UCD stranded harbor seals.

SRP076355	Redefining the Chronic Wound Microbiome: Fungal Communities Are Prevalent, Dynamic, and Associated with Delayed Healing	The microbiome can profoundly influence the balance between human health and disease. Chronic non-healing wounds have been heralded as a silent epidemic, causing significant morbidity and mortality especially in elderly, diabetic, and obese populations. Polymicrobial communities, often described as biofilms in the wound bed, are hypothesized to disrupt the highly coordinated and sequential events of cutaneous healing. Both culture-dependent and -independent studies of the chronic wound microbiome have almost exclusively focused on bacterial communities, omitting what we hypothesize are important fungal contributions to impaired healing and development of complication. Here we show for the first time that fungal communities (the mycobiome) in chronic wounds are predictive of healing time, associated with wound necrosis and poor outcomes, and may act synergistically to form mixed fungal-bacterial biofilms. We longitudinally profiled 100 chronic, non-healing diabetic foot ulcers with high-throughput sequencing of the pan-fungal internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) locus, estimating that up to 80% of wounds contain fungi. In contrast, cultures performed in parallel captured fungi in only 5% of colonized wounds. The â€˜mycobiomeâ€™ exhibited high levels of temporal instability and heterogeneity between subjects. Fungal diversity increased with antibiotic administration, wound deterioration or onset of infection-related complications, such as osteomyelitis. Proportions of the phlyum Ascomycota were significantly greater (p=0.015) at the study onset in wounds that took >8 weeks to heal. Wound necrosis was distinctly associated with pathogenic fungal species, while a second major group of taxa identified as allergenic filamentous fungi, were associated with low levels of systemic inflammation. Directed culturing of wounds stably colonized by pathogens revealed that Candida albicans and Trichosporon asahii form mixed biofilms with co-isolated Citrobacter fruendii and Staphylococcus simulans, respectively. Combined, our analyses provide enhanced resolution of the mycobiome during impaired wound healing, its role in chronic disease, and impact on clincal outcomes.	SRR3656239,SRR3656240,SRR3656437

SRP074222	Characterization of the nasopharyngeal microbiota in naturally occurring respiratory disease in feedlot cattle	Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) is a major cause of morbidity, mortality and economic loss in the US cattle industry. In view of the importance of this disease complex, and the need to reduce antimicrobial use in food producing animals, there is growing interest in developing novel strategies to enhance host immune defenses against respiratory pathogens. The cooperative interactions between microbes and their hosts have been recognized for years, and there is increasing evidence that mucosal bacterial populations act, not only as a reservoir of potential pathogens, but also in regulating local and systemic immune homeostasis through a complex cross talk with the epithelium, local immune system and mucosal neuronal pathways. In this study we used culture-independent techniques to characterize the nasopharyngeal microbiome of cattle during the initial processing phase in the commercial feedlot. In addition, we compared the dynamics of change in these microbial communities, between clinically healthy calves and those that develop BRD within the first month of entry in to the feedlot.

SRP064390	Meadow Soil samples from Angelo, CA Genome sequencing and assembly	Methylotrophy and archaeal heterotrophy dominate carbon turnover below the grass root zoneAnnually, half of all plant-derived carbon is added to soil; most is rapidly respired to CO2 but some is exported to sustain life in lower horizons and the deeper biosphere. Little is known about the microbial communities that respond to these carbon pulses and the biochemical pathways involved. We found that bacterial degradation of methyl compounds was pronounced below the grass root zone in the Fall rainy season. This process limits supply of methyl compounds for methanogenesis in the deeper subsurface. Archaea, which comprised ~20% of microbial communities in deeper soil, degrade organic carbon, including aromatic compounds. Populations display dandelion-like patterns of diversity, and many affiliate with largely unknown bacterial and archaeal phyla, underlining the roles of novel organisms in soil carbon cycling.

Two different soil samples were obtained corresponding totimes with different gene expression patterns in P. pinaster. The first sample was taken in March and the second one in July. The sampling was made in Los Reales de Sierra Bermeja (Estepona, Spain) with the present UTM coordinates North 30S 303095 4034618 and 1245m of altitude.Sierra Bermeja is a mountain range in the southern Spain near the coast and it is the biggest massif of peridotite all over the world. The peridotiteis a dense, coarse-grained igneous rock, consisting mostly of the minerals olivine and pyroxene. The samples were from the soil around three trees (70 cm approx. from the tree stem) and three different samples were taken from each tree(3 trees x 3 samples = 9 samples per each time). Total DNA from the soil samples were extracted by triplicate (9 x 3 = 27 DNA samples per each time) and the resulting DNA was pooled with equivalent amounts from each DNA samples. Each soil DNA pool was processed and sequenced in a Roche 454 Titanium FLX+ sequencer. Half PicoTiterPlete was used for each sample.	ERR351520,ERR351521

In this longitudinal study we used shotgun sequencing of stool DNA to look at taxonomic and functional changes at different phases of the program. In 2 years we sequenced fecal samples at six time points, the baseline (before intervention, = T0), after diet intervention, (3 months later: T3), after reintroduction phase (T6), and three time points at the maintenance phase i.e. month 12 (T12), month 18 (T18) and month 24 (T24). In parallel, clinical parameters were monitored in order to establish potential relationships between microbiota and obesity-associated-disease particularly hypertension, insulin resistance, fatty liver and the metabolic syndrome. Moreover we analyzed the marker potential of microbial parameters for weight loss maintenance success.

Studying the DNA and metabolic profiling of microbial communities could help to establish more effective prevention and treatment against potential microbial agents.   Subclinical mastitis-affected milk samples of Kankrej and Gir cattle (Bos indicus) were collected from Livestock Research Station (LRS) and samples of crossbred cattle (Bos taurus X Bos indicus) were collected from Livestock Production and Management (LPM) cattle farms in Anand town of Gujarat State, India. Quarter milk samples were collected aseptically in sterile wide mouth glass stopper bottles on three consecutive days. The udder was washed thoroughly with potassium permanganate solution (1:1000) and the teats were wiped with 70% ethyl alcohol prior to sampling.	SRR493932,SRR493933,SRR493934
ERP000339	Viral metagenomic study of two freshwater Lakes.	Viruses are known to be the most abundant biological entities in     aquatic environment, where they are (i) important top-down regulation factors for     microbial communities, (ii) known to interfere in major biogeochemical cycles, and     (iii) thought to be an important source of genetic diversity. Yet, diversity and     distribution of these viruses is still far from being understood, especially in     freshwater ecosystems. Metagenomic analysis of two different temperate freshwater     viral communities showed that most of the viral sequences were not similar to those     in the current databases. A deep sequencing (1.5 billion sequences) associated to a     large read size (400 bp) allowed us to assess, for the first time, the diversity in     the main viral families through direct phylogenetic analysis of specific marker     genes. The analysis of the major viral groups found in the two lakes shed light on a     great diversity, and retrieved previously unknown clades among single-stranded DNA     viruses (Microviridae, Circoviridae, Nanoviridae) and among Caudovirales. The     absence of lake-specific clade indicated that the new viruses identified were     ubiquitous, at least on a regional freshwater lake scale. Compared to the previously     published viromes, a significant genetic similarity between viral communities of     related environments was highlighted for the first time, despite the great     geographical distances separating these different communities. Thus, viruses appear     to be distributed worldwide, and are likely selected by the presence or absence of     their hosts. Gene richness analysis assessed through rarefaction curves showed an     extraordinary genetic diversity of viruses in each of the two lakes under study.     Such diversity was never retrieved previously, even in the last generation of     published viromes. The global virome is thereby a fantastic pool of unknown genes,     which remains partially sampled and understood.	ERR019478

SRP078001	Maturation of the Infant Microbiome Community Structure and Function Across Multiple Body Sites	Human microbial communities are characterized by their metagenomic and metabolic diversity, which varies by distinct body sites and influences human physiology. However, it is not yet known when in early development our microbiota community structure and function is initially established and diversifies. We thus sought to assess the taxonomic composition and potential metabolic function of the neonatal and early infant microbiota, and assess the impact of mode of delivery and its potential confounders or modifiers. A cohort of pregnant women (n=81) were prospectively enrolled for longitudinal sampling through 6 weeks post-delivery, and a second matched cross-sectional cohort (n=81) was additionally recruited for sampling once at delivery. Samples were collected for each maternal-infant dyad across multiple body sites, including stool, oral gingiva, nares, skin and vagina. 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis and whole genome shotgun sequencing was performed to interrogate the composition and function of the neonatal and maternal microbiota. We found that the neonatal microbiota and its associated functional pathways were relatively homogenous across all body sites at delivery, with the notable exception of neonatal meconium. However, by 6 weeks, the infant microbiota structure and function had significantly expanded and diversified, with body site serving as the primary determinant of the bacterial community composition and its functional capacity. Although minor variations in the neonatal (immediately at birth) microbiota community structure were associated with Cesarean delivery in some body sites (oral, nares, and skin; p<0.001, R2 = 0.038), this was not true in neonatal stool (meconium) and there was no observable difference in community function regardless of delivery mode. By 6 weeks of age, the infant microbiota structure and function had expanded and diversified with demonstrable body site specificity (p<0.001, R2 = 0.189), and no discernable differences in neither community structure nor function by Cesarean delivery were identifiable (p=0.057, R2 = 0.007). We conclude that within the first 6 weeks of life, the infant microbiota undergoes significant reorganization that is primarily driven by body site and not by mode of delivery.

ERP017505	The effects of micronutrient deficiencies on bacterial species from the human gut microbiota	Vitamin and mineral (micronutrient) deficiencies afflict 2 billion people. Although the impact of these imbalances on host biology has been studied extensively, much less is known about their effects on the gut microbiota of developing or adult humans. Therefore, we established a community of cultured, sequenced human gutâ€“derived bacterial species in gnotobiotic mice and fed the animals a defined micronutrient-sufficient diet, followed by a derivative diet devoid of vitamin A, folate, iron, or zinc, followed by return to the sufficient diet. Acute vitamin A deficiency had the largest effect on bacterial community structure and metatranscriptome, with Bacteroides vulgatus, a prominent responder, increasing its abundance in the absence of vitamin A. Applying retinol selection to a library of 30,300 B. vulgatus transposon mutants revealed that disruption of acrR abrogated retinol sensitivity. Genetic complementation studies, microbial RNA sequencing, and transcription factorâ€“binding assays disclosed that AcrR is a repressor of an adjacent AcrAB-TolC efflux system. Retinol efflux measurements in wild-type and acrR-mutant strains plus treatmentwith a pharmacologic inhibitor of the efflux system revealed that AcrAB-TolC is a determinant of retinol and bile acid sensitivity in B. vulgatus. Acute vitamin A deficiency was associated with altered bile acid metabolism in vivo, raising the possibility that retinol, bile acid metabolites, and AcrAB-TolC interact to influence the fitness of B. vulgatus and perhaps other microbiota members. This type of preclinical model can help to develop mechanistic insights about and more effective treatment strategies for micronutrient deficiencies.

SRP002163	Human Microbiome Project (HMP) Metagenomic WGS Projects, deeper sequencing of the human microbiome samples: Production Phase	The HMP metagenomes production phase represents the shotgun sequencing of metagenomic DNA extracted from samples taken from multiple body sites across hundreds of human subjects. Coupled with the other data generated during the HMP project, these results will provide insights into the genes and pathways present in the human microbiome. We are learning more and more about the ways that human health is influenced by the complex and dynamic communities of microbes (the human microbiota) present on and within our bodies.

SRP060764	Horse feces Raw sequence reads	In equids, susceptibility to disease caused by Rhodococcus equi occurs almost exclusively in foals. This distribution might be attributable to the age-dependent maturation of immunity following birth undergone by mammalian neonates that renders them especially susceptible to infectious diseases. Expansion and diversification of the neonatal microbiome contribute to development of immunity in the gut. Moreover, diminished diversity of the gastrointestinal microbiome has been associated with risk of infections and immune dysregulation. We thus hypothesized that varying composition or reduced diversity of the intestinal microbiome of neonatal foals would contribute to increased susceptibility of their developing R. equi pneumonia. The composition and diversity indices of the fecal microbiota at 3 and 5 weeks of age were compared among 3 groups of foals: 1) foals that subsequently developed R. equi pneumonia after sampling; 2) foals that subsequently developed ultrasonographic evidence of pulmonary abscess formation or consolidation but not clinical signs (subclinical group); and, 3) foals that developed neither clinical signs nor ultrasonographic evidence of pulmonary abscess formation or consolidation. No significant differences were found among groups at either sampling time, indicating absence of evidence of an influence of composition or diversity of the fecal microbiome, or predicted fecal metagenome, on susceptibility to subsequent R. equi pneumonia. A marked and significant difference identified between a relatively short interval of time appeared to reflect ongoing adaptation to transition from a milk diet to a diet including available forage (including hay) and access to concentrate fed to the mare.

SRP000782	Confirmation of the sequence of "Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus" and assessment of microbial diversity in Huanglongbing-infected citrus phloem using a metagenomic approach	The citrus disease, Huanglongbing (HLB), is a highly destructive disease in many citrus-growing regions of the world.  As Koch's postulates have not been completed and the putative causal agent of this disease, Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus, is difficult to culture, progress in studying this disease has been limited. As a result, efforts have focused on obtaining the genome sequence of Ca. L. asiaticus in order to give insight on the physiology of this organism.  In this work, three next generation high throughput sequencing platforms, 454, Solexa, and SOLiD, were used to obtain metagenomic DNA sequences from phloem tissue infected with a defined isolate of HLB.  A culture independent analysis of 16S rRNA in these sequences showed the only bacterium present within the phloem metagenome was Ca L. asiaticus.  No viral or viroid sequences were identified within the metagenomic DNA.  By reference assembly, the phloem metagenome contained sequences that provided 26-fold coverage of the Ca L. asiaticus contigs in GenBank.  By the same approach, phloem metagenomic data contained less than 0.2-fold coverage of five other alphaproteobacterial genomes.  Thus, phloem metagenomic DNA provide a PCR-independent means of verifying the presence of Ca. L. asiaticus in infected tissue and strongly suggest no other disease agent is present in phloem.

ERP104026	Salt-responsive gut commensal modulates TH17 axis and disease	Western lifestyle with high salt consumption leads tohypertension and cardiovascular disease. High salt may additionallydrive autoimmunity by inducing T helper (T H )17 cells, which may alsocontribute to hypertension. Induction of T H 17 cells depends on the gutmicrobiota, yet the effect of salt on the gut microbiome is unknown. Inmouse model systems, we show that high salt intake affects the gutmicrobiome, particularly by depleting Lactobacillus murinus.Consequently, L. murinus treatment prevents salt-induced aggravation ofexperimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and salt-sensitivehypertension, by modulating T H 17 cells. In line with these findings,moderate high salt challenge in humans reduces intestinal survival ofLactobacillus spp. along with increased T H 17 cells and blood pressure.Our results connect high salt intake to the gut-immune axis andhighlight the gut microbiome as a potential therapeutic target tocounteract salt-sensitive conditions.

ERP009562	Tales from the crypt: Genome mining from fungarium specimens improves resolution of the mushroom tree of life	The enormous breadth and depth of specimens held within the world's biological collections offer an unparalleled opportunity to capture genomic data from across the entire range of known biological diversityâ€”a task that would take many lifetimes to complete if we could rely only on fresh samples. High-throughput sequencing provides a technical solution to the long-term problems of recalcitrant and degraded DNA typical of museum specimens, suggesting that we may be on the verge of a major collections-based revolution. Although the potential is great, the feasibility of using preserved collections for large-scale, taxonomically comprehensive phylogenomic studies remains unknown. Here we demonstrate the continued relevance of fungarium collections in the genomic era by analysing a genomic dataset composed of 39 genomes, including 14 newly generated draft genomes derived from short-read shotgun sequencing of preserved specimens, frozen and freeze-dried material, representing most of the known families of Agaricales. We predicted homologs of 210 putative single copy genes in the newly generated draft genome assemblies, of which 208 were used for phylogenetic reconstruction. Our analyses resulted in a robust and, for the first time, fully supported phylogeny of the Agaricales, supporting the recognition of eight new suborders and providing a resource for testing hypotheses of the evolution of mushrooms. Our analysis of optimal combinations of ranked genes using an information theory-based method provides guidance on gene selection for future studies, enabling efficient application of high-throughput sequencing techniques toward unlocking the potential of collections-based research in the genomic era.

ERP001979	Metagenomic study of the virome of African straw-colored fruit bats	Viral emergence as a result of zoonotic transmission constitutes a continuous public health threat. Emerging viruses such as SARS Coronavirus,  Hantaviruses and Henipaviruses have a wildlife animal reservoir. Characterizing the viral flora of candidate reservoir species in geographical areas identified as hot spots for viral emergence is a sensible approach to develop tools to predict,  prevent or contain emergence events. Here,  we explored the viral flora of Eidolon helvum,  an Old World fruit bat species widely distributed in Africa that lives in close proximity to humans. We identified a great abundance and diversity of novel herpes and papillomaviruses,  described the isolation of a novel adenovirus,  and detected,  for the first time,  sequences of a chiropteran poxvirus that are closely related to a human contagion. In sum,  E. helvum display a wide variety of mammalian viruses,  some of them genetically similar to known human pathogens,  highlighting the possibility of zoonotic transmission.	ERR198831

SRP011425	Virus identification in unknown tropical febrile illness cases using deep sequencing	Dengue virus is an emerging infectious agent that infects an estimated 50-100 million people annually worldwide, yet current diagnostic practices cannot detect an etiologic pathogen in ~40% of dengue-like illnesses. Metagenomic approaches to pathogen detection, such as viral microarrays and deep sequencing, are promising tools to address emerging and non-diagnosable disease challenges. In this study, we used the Virochip microarray and deep sequencing to characterize the spectrum of viruses present in human sera from 123 Nicaraguan patients presenting with dengue-like symptoms but testing negative for dengue virus. We utilized a barcoding strategy to simultaneously deep sequence multiple serum specimens, generating on average over 1 million reads per sample. We then implemented a stepwise bioinformatic filtering pipeline to remove the majority of human and low-quality sequences to improve the speed and accuracy of subsequent unbiased database searches. By deep sequencing, we were able to detect virus sequence in 37% (45/123) of previously negative cases. These included 13 cases with Human Herpesvirus 6 sequences. Other samples contained sequences with similarity to sequences from viruses in the Herpesviridae, Flaviviridae, Circoviridae, Anelloviridae, Asfarviridae, and Parvoviridae families. In some cases, the putative viral sequences were virtually identical to known viruses, and in others they diverged, suggesting that they may derive from novel viruses. These results demonstrate the utility of unbiased metagenomic approaches in the detection of known and divergent viruses in the study of tropical febrile illness.

SRP117625	Investigating the viral ecology of global bee communities with high-throughput metagenomics	The ecology of bee viruses is complex, as viruses are readily shared among bee species and plants. However, our understanding of bee viral communities is primarily derived from studies of North America and European Apis mellifera honey bee populations. Here, we develop a novel pipeline to rapidly, inexpensively, and robustly screen for bee viruses. This pipeline includes purification of encapsulated RNA/DNA viruses, sequence-independent amplification, high throughput sequencing, integrated assembly of contigs, and screening through a series of filters to identify contigs specifically corresponding to viral sequences. We evaluated samples of honey bees and co-foraging non-Apis bee species (12 bee species in total) from 9 countries and 5 continents. We identified sequences corresponding to (+)ssRNA, (-)ssRNA, dsRNA, and ssDNA viruses. Overall, 127 contigs corresponding to novel viruses (previously not observed in bees), with 29 represented by >0.1% of the reads in a given sample. These 29 contigs corresponded to 9 viral families, including 6 viral families that have not been previously observed in bees. These viruses and viral families were distributed across multiple regions and species. This study provides a robust pipeline for analysis of insect viruses, and greatly expands our understanding of the diversity of viruses found in bee communities.

ERP008710	A Catalogue of the Mouse Gut Metagenome	The importance of the gut microbiota for regulation of whole body metabolism, energy homeostasis, development of the immune system and even complex behavioural traits is well documented. The acquisition of comprehensive gene catalogues of the human gut metagenome using â€œnext generation sequencingâ€ has immensely advanced our insight into the complex metagenome-host genome interaction and the connection between common human diseases and the gut microbiota. Causal links are difficult to establish in humans, and therefore, mice still serve as important models for functional studies. We used HiSeq2000-based whole metagenome sequencing to establish a catalogue of 2.6 million non-redundant microbial genes from faecal samples of 184 mice representing different strains, fed different diets, obtained from different providers, and kept in different housing laboratories to secure high diversity and representation. Similar to the human gut microbiome, more than 99% of the genes in the catalogue were bacterial, suggesting that the mouse microbiota overall comprises between 800 and 900 bacterial species. A core mouse gut microbiome was defined at the genus level comprising 60 genera, 25 of which were shared with the core genera in the human gut microbiome. Although the mouse gut microbiome was functionally similar to its human counterpart, sharing 79.9% of its KEGG orthologous groups, only 4.0% of the mouse gut microbial genes were shared with those identified in human gut microbiome, emphasising the need for a specific mouse catalogue. We observed marked differences regarding provider, housing laboratory, strains, gender and feed, emphasizing the need for carefully controlled experimental conditions and caution comparing data from different laboratories.   As we have accounted for these factors in creating the catalogue, it provides a useful reference for future studies, including studies using short reads for comprehensive analyses of the mouse gut microbiome.

ERP005292	Structure and functions of the bacterial root microbiota in wild and domesticated barley and signatures of positive selection in the rhizosphere metagenome	We have profiled the rhizosphere and the root bacterial communities retrieved from soil-grown, wild, landrace and modern accessions of barley using a 16S rRNA gene amplicon pyrosequencing approach. Phylogenetic assignment of the generated sequencing reads revealed that the microbial communities thriving at the barley root-soil interface appears to be gated, as indicated by a narrow phylogenetic composition, largely dominated by members of the families Flavobacteriaceae, Rhizobiaceae and Comamonadaceae Interestingly, constrained ordinations and linear model analysis revealed that host microhabitats (i.e. root and rhizosphere) are the major determinants of the barley microbiota, while the host genotype determines its ribotype profiles to a limited extent, suggesting that the structure of the barley microbiota is a conserved trait in the tested accessions.  To gain insights on the molecular cues underlying microbial recruitment at the root-soil interface, we reconstructed 20Gbp of the barley rhizosphere metagenome. Interestingly, we observed that ~10% of the protein families encoded by the barley microbiome display a ratio between non-synonymous and synonymous substitutions (w) significantly higher than the mean of the sequenced metagenome. Intriguingly, these data might indicate an evolutionary pressure on proteins required for the microbial colonisation of the rhizosphere. Remarkably, proteins previously reported in host-microbe interactions studies (e.g. putative bacterial effectors) showed a w significantly different across genotypes, suggesting that host genetic traits contribute, at least in part, to bacterial functional diversification in the rhizosphere.  Our work provides a foundation for future studies aiming at the characterisation of the genetic bases of plant-microbiota interactions and, in the long term, the introgression of the microbiota metabolic potential into plant breeding	ERR646488,ERR647605,ERR647606,ERR647607,ERR647608,ERR647609

ERP019886	Commensal_bacterial_community_screening	Commensal bacteria colonizing the intestinal tract have an established role in helping maintaining a protective mucus barrier against pathogenic organisms, and in modulating intestinal immunity. FUT2 gene is responsible for intestinal fucosylation on epithelial cells. However, 20 â€“ 30% of individuals in European, Asian and African populations are homozygous for a non-functional allele of FUT2 gene and therefore they cannot express fucosylated glycans in their mucus and other secretions (non-secretors). FUT2 gene has previously been demonstrated to play an essential role in shaping the microbiota and non-secretor status has been associated in GWAS studies with inflammatory bowel disease, a dysbiosis-associated intestinal chronic disease. Knowing the changes that occur in secretors and non-secretors microbiota structure would help to better understand the impact that FUT2 gene has on human intestinal microbiota. To address this point, healthy individual stool samples underwent bacterial DNA extraction and were subjected to standard metagenomics sequencing. To increase the metagenomic analysis resolution bacteria were cultured and whole-genome sequenced.  Culturable microbiota communities grown from each donor were also pooled and analysed using standard metagenomics sequencing.

ERP003666	Functional genes to assess nitrogen cycling and aromatic hydrocarbon degradation: primers and processing matter	Targeting sequencing to genes involved in key ecofunctional pathways provides an opportunity to sample natureâ€™s gene guild to greater depth and help link community structure to process-level outcomes. Vastly different approaches have been implemented for sequence processing and, ultimately, for taxonomic placement of these gene reads. The overall quality of next generation sequence analysis of functional genes is dependent on multiple steps and assumptions of unknown diversity. To illustrate current issues surrounding amplicon read processing we provide examples for three ecofunctional gene groups. A combination of in-silico, environmental and cultured strain sequences was used to test new primers targeting the dioxin and dibenzofuran degrading genes dxnA1, dbfA1, and carAa. The majority of obtained environmental sequences were classified into novel sequence clusters, illustrating the discovery value of the approach. Assessment and improvement of primer coverage is critical to enhancing comprehensiveness of ecofunctional gene recovery. Well-known nirK primers exhibited deficiencies in reference database coverage, illustrating the need to refine primer-binding sites and/or to design multiple primers, while nirS primers exhibited bias against the Chloroflexi, Deinococcus-Thermus, Aquificales and Bacteroidetes. Amino acid-based OTU clustering of the two N-cycle genes from soil samples yielded only 114 unique nirK and 45 unique nirS genera, likely a reflection of constricted primer coverage. Finally, supervised and non-supervised OTU analysis methods were compared using the nifH gene of nitrogen fixation, with generally similar outcomes, but the clustering (non-supervised) method yielded higher diversity estimates and stronger site-based differences. Current databases for most ecofunctional genes are less complete than for nifH, and hence clustering would be preferred. High throughput amplicon sequencing can provide inexpensive and rapid access to natureâ€™s related sequences by circumventing the culturing barrier, but each unique gene requires individual considerations in terms of primer design, and sequence processing and classification.

ERP006615	Metagenomic analysis of sediments along a uranium gradient	Surface sediment from a billabong in the Northern Territory of Australia was collected and spiked with uranyl sulfate at 6 different concentrations (0 - 4,000 mg/ kg). The sediments were then re-deployed at the site and left in these natural environmental conditions for 5 months. DNA was extracted from the sediments and submitted for metagenomic sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 instrument.

ERP005584	Interactions between anaerobic ammonium and sulfur-oxidizing bacteria in a laboratory scale model system	The recycling of fixed nitrogen from marine systems proceeds via two different nitrogen removal pathways, namely denitrification or anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox). Both processes require oxidized N (i.e. nitrate or nitrite) as electron acceptor to ultimately release dinitrogen gas (N2). For a supply with its substrates (ammonium and nitrite) anammox activity depends on the tight coupling with other nitrogen transformations.  The aerobic oxidation of ammonium is one of the routes that have been described recently as a source of nitrite. Another possibility is the linkage of the aforementioned N2-releasing processes, a scenario in which denitrification might be providing substrates for anammox. We were especially interested in coupling sulfide-dependent denitrification to anammox, as sulfide is, besides oxygen, the most important reductant at the chemocline of marine anoxic basins and also abundant within sediments. Although sulfide is toxic at ÂµM concentrations and has been shown to have a negative effect on anammox activity, we hypothesize that denitrification converts sulfide and nitrate, thereby allowing anammox to stay active despite an influx of sulfide and supply them with nitrite from partial denitrification.

ERP001500	Human gut microbiome viewed across age and geography	Gut microbial communities represent one source of human genetic and metabolic diversity. To examine how gut microbiomes differ among human populations, here we characterize bacterial species in fecal samples from 531 individuals, plus the gene content of 110 of them. The cohort encompassed healthy children and adults from the Amazonas of Venezuela, rural Malawi and US metropolitan areas and included mono- and dizygotic twins. Shared features of the functional maturation of the gut microbiome were identified during the first three years of life in all three populations, including age-associated changes in the genes involved in vitamin biosynthesis and metabolism. Pronounced differences in bacterial assemblages and functional gene repertoires were noted between US residents and those in the other two countries. These distinctive features are evident in early infancy as well as adulthood. Our findings underscore the need to consider the microbiome when evaluating human development, nutritional needs, physiological variations and the impact of westernization.	ERR139501

SRP117640	Quasi-metagenomics detection and subtyping of Salmonella enterica from food samples	Both culture enrichment and next-generation sequencing remain to be time-consuming processes for food testing where rapid methods for pathogen detection are widely available. Our study demonstrated substantial acceleration of the respective process through IMS-MDA and real-time nanopore sequencing. In one example, the combined use of the two methods delivered a less than 24 h turnaround time from a Salmonella-contaminated lettuce sample to strain-level identification of the pathogen. Improved efficiency like this is important for further expanding the use of whole genome and metagenomics sequencing in microbial analysis of food. Our results suggest the potential of the quasi-metagenomics approach in areas where rapid detection and subtyping of foodborne pathogens is important, such as foodborne outbreak response and precision tracking and monitoring of foodborne pathogens in production environments and supply chains.

ERP013563	Gut microbiome-dependent stratification of patients for anti-diabetic treatment	Dysbosis of intestinal microbiota could contribute to the pathogenesis of Type 2 Diabetes. It is yet to be known whether intestinal flora could be related to differential responds to antidiabetic therapies. This study, herein for the first time, metagenomic sequenced fecal samples from a randomized clinical trial on new onset untreated Type 2 Diabetes patients applied two treatment arms, Acarbose and Glipizide (Sulfonylurea) and analyzed the differential responses of intestinal flora in different groups. Results showed substantial impact of Acarbose on gut microbiota community but minor of Glipizide. Enterotypes with similar baseline clinical characteristics, had significant different pharmacologic respond to Acarbose on insulin resistance, gut hormones, bile acids and cardiovascular risks, indicating that different pattern of intestinal microbiota component could determine different responses of Type 2 Diabetes to antidiabetic pharmacological therapies.

ERP010700	Shotgun Metagenomics of 250 Adult Twins Reveals Genetic and Environmental Impacts on the Gut Microbiome	The gut microbiota has been typically viewed as an environmental factor for human health. Twins are well suited for investigating the concordance of their gut microbiomes and decomposing genetic and environmental influences. However, existing twin studies utilizing metagenomic shotgun sequencing have included only a few samples. Here, we sequenced fecal samples from 250 adult twins in the TwinsUK registry and constructed a comprehensive gut microbial reference gene catalog. We demonstrate heritability of many microbial taxa and functional modules in the gut microbiome, including those associated with diseases. Moreover, we identified 8 million SNPs in the gut microbiome and observe a high similarity in microbiome SNPs between twins that slowly decreases after decades of living apart. The results shed new light on the genetic and environmental influences on the composition and function of the gut microbiome that could relate to risk of complex diseases.

ERP003782	Convergence of gut microbiomes in myrmecophagous mammals	Mammals have diversified into many dietary niches. Specialized myrmecophagous (ant- and termite-eating) placental mammals represent a textbook example of evolutionary convergence driven by extreme diet specialization. Armadillos, anteaters, aardvarks, pangolins, and aardwolves thus provide a model system for understanding the potential role of gut microbiota in the convergent adaptation to myrmecophagy. Here, we expand upon previous mammalian gut microbiome studies by using high-throughput barcoded Illumina sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene to characterize the composition of gut microbiota in 15 species representing all placental myrmecophagous lineages and their close relatives from zoo- and field-collected samples. We confirm that both diet and phylogeny drive the evolution of mammalian gut microbiota, with cases of convergence in global composition, but also examples of phylogenetic inertia. Our results reveal specialized placental myrmecophages as a spectacular case of large-scale convergence in gut microbiome composition. Indeed, Neighbor-Net networks and beta diversity plots based on UniFrac distances show significant clustering of myrmecophagous species (anteaters, aardvarks, and aardwolves) even though they belong to phylogenetically distant lineages representing different orders. The aardwolf, which diverged from carnivorous hyenas only in the last 10 million years, experienced a convergent shift in the composition of its gut microbiome to become more similar to other myrmecophages. These results confirm diet adaptation to be a major driving factor of convergence in gut microbiome composition over evolutionary timescales. This study sets the scene for future metagenomic studies aiming at evaluating potential convergence in functional gene content in the microbiomes of specialized mammalian myrmecophages.	ERR328003

SRP090992	Trade-off between taxon diversity and functional diversity in European lake ecosystems	Inferring ecosystem functioning and ecosystem services through inspections of the species inventory is a major aspect of ecological field studies. Ecosystem functions are often stable despite considerable species turnover. Using metatranscriptome analyses, we analyse a thus-far unparalleled freshwater dataset which comprises 21 mainland European freshwater lakes from the Sierra Nevada (Spain) to the Carpathian Mountains (Romania) and from northern Germany to the Apennines (Italy) and covers an altitudinal range from 38 m above sea level (a.s.l) to 3110 m a.s.l. The dominant taxa were Chlorophyta and streptophytic algae, Ciliophora, Bacillariophyta and Chrysophyta. Metatranscriptomics provided insights into differences in community composition and into functional diversity via the relative share of taxa to the overall read abundance of distinct functional genes on the ecosystem level. The dominant metabolic pathways in terms of the fraction of expressed sequences in the cDNA libraries were affiliated with primary metabolism, specifically oxidative phosphorylation, photosynthesis and the TCA cycle. Our analyses indicate that community composition is a good first proxy for the analysis of ecosystem functions. However, differential gene regulation modifies the relative importance of taxa in distinct pathways. Whereas taxon composition varies considerably between lakes, the relative importance of distinct metabolic pathways is much more stable, indicating that ecosystem functioning is buffered against shifts in community composition through a functional redundancy of taxa.

SRP005264	Harvard Forest soil microbial gene expression	This project sequenced the metagenome and metatranscriptome of a temperate forest soil microbial community.  Soil was collected from within a transition hardwood-white pine/hemlock forest in the Prospect Hill Tract of Harvard Forest (Massachusetts, USA; 42.54 N 72.18W; elevation: 385 m) on 27 September, 2010.  Two cores were taken from 1-10 cm below the leaf horizon using a 10 mm diameter soil corer.  These cores were homogenized, placed into 50 ml Falcon tubes, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and transported to the lab on dry ice.  Visible pieces of plant material were removed from soil subsamples with sterile forceps.  During plant removal, the subsamples were placed on a sterile surface, laid within a bed of dry ice.  Total microbial DNA and RNA was then extracted from these subsamples using PowerSoil Total RNA and DNA isolation kits (MoBio), according to the manufacturer''s protocol.  Total DNA was quantified and used directly for pyrosequencing.  Total RNA was further processed to reduce the proportion of ribosomal RNA transcripts via a custom subtractive hybridization procedure.  Remaining total RNA was then linearly amplified, converted to cDNA, and used for pyrosequencing.  Soil DNA and cDNA were sequenced with full plate runs on a Roche Genome Sequencer FLX instrument using Titanium chemistry.	SRR091237

ERP019674	The fecal microbiota in L-DOPA naive PD patients	Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD) presently is conceptualized as a protein aggregation disease in which pathology involves both, the enteric and the central nervous system, possibly spreading from one to another via the vagus nerves. As gastrointestinal dysfunction often precedes or parallels motor symptoms, the enteric system with its vast diversity of microorganisms may be involved in PD pathogenesis. Alterations in the enteric microbial taxonomic level of L-DOPA-naÃ¯ve PD patients might also serve as a biomarker.We thus compared the fecal microbiomes of 31 early stage, L-DOPA-naive PD subjects to 28 age matched controls by metagenomic analysis.

ERP020572	Intergenerational transfer of antibiotic-perturbed microbiota enhances colitis in susceptible mice	Antibiotics have long-lasting consequences on the gut microbiota with the potential to impact host physiology and health. However, little is known about the transgenerational impact of an antibiotic-perturbed microbiota. Here we demonstrated that adult pregnant female mice inoculated with a gut microbial community shaped by antibiotic exposure passed on their dysbiotic microbiota to their offspring. This dysbiotic microbiota remained distinct from controls for at least 5 months in the offspring without any continued exposure to antibiotics. By using IL-10 deficient mice, which are genetically susceptible to colitis, we showed mice that received an antibiotic-perturbed gut microbiota from their mothers had increased risk of colitis. Taken together, our findings indicate that the consequences of antibiotic exposure affecting the gut microbiota can extend to a second generation.

SRP000109	Planktonic microbial communities from North Pacific Subtropical Gyre	This project consists of analyses of of planktonic microbial communities in a region of the North Pacific Ocean. The Subtropical Gyre consists of a clockwise swirling vortex of ocean currents that make up most of the northern Pacific Ocean. Samples were taken at different depths (10 m to 4000 m) at the Hawaii open-ocean time-series station ALOHA  (22<sup>o</sup>45'' N, 158<sup>o</sup>W) and large DNA fragments were cloned (36 kbp fosmids) from the samples and shotgun sequenced. A comparison of protein sequences encoded by samples at various depths and clustering of functional categories revealed definite gradients. For example, proteins involved in photosynthesis were found in the photic zone, as expected, while proteins involved in surface attachment were more prevalent in deep samples, suggesting a greater tendency for surface colonization at those ocean depths.

ERP017152	The Effect of High Oxalate Exposure on the Gut Microbiota of Neotoma albigula	The mammalian gut microbiota is a complex ecosystem with hundreds to thousands of interacting species and numerous ecological niches, in a nearly closed off system primarily shaped by host physiology and diet.  Given the complexity of this system, it is difficult to elucidate specific interactions that shape the gut microbiota and its response to a dietary challenge. Oxalate, a simple organic acid widely distributed among plants, is a carbon and energy source for some gut bacteria that cannot be metabolized by mammalian enzymes.  Therefore, this compound can be used to identify fundamental ecological interactions between diet and the gut microbiota without confounding factors associated with other dietary components or host physiology.  We examined interactions between oxalate and the gut microbiota of the mammalian herbivore Neotoma albigula, which consumes a high oxalate diet in the wild.   By comparing the relative abundance of genes and metabolic pathways in the gut microbiota after exposure to 0.2% oxalate or 6% oxalate, we will elucidate those pathways that are enriched or inhibited by high oxalate exposure.

ERP014351	A_plaque_on_both_your_houses__Exploring_the_history_of_urbanisation_and_infectious_diseases_through_the_study_of_archaeological_dental_tartar	Increasing urbanisation has created epidemic incubators, fuelling infectious diseases and often increasing susceptibility to them. Longitudinal perspectives on the socio-environmental conditions which shape the emergence and 're-emergence' of infectious diseases can help to mitigate and prevent epidemics in rapidly urbanising nations. Regrettably, human health experiences throughout much of (pre-)history of urbanisation remain clouded by a lack of reliable data on disease exposure and transmission. This project will develop an innovative new approach, which recovers evidence for infectious disease exposure directly from the mouths of skeletons. We have recently discovered that archaeological dental tartar (mineralized plaque) entraps and preserves DNA and proteins from multiple oral and systemic infectious disease pathogens. Uniquely, this can provide insight into past microbial landscapes and disease exposure rates information not previously available through historical or archaeological analyses. The objectives of this project are: 1) to develop new molecular pilot data on disease exposure in the historically well-documented context of Industrial England; 2) interrogate and corroborate these pilot data drawing upon multi-disciplinary expertise in York; and 3) to forge a multi-institutional network investigating historic disease environments and the dynamics of human-pathogen co-habitation throughout the history of urbanisation.

SRP098739	Viral metagenomics reveal blooms of anelloviruses in the respiratory tract of lung transplant recipients	Few studies have examined the lung virome in health and disease. Outcomes of lung transplantation are known to be influenced by several recognized respiratory viruses, but global understanding of the virome of the transplanted lung is incomplete. To define the DNA virome within the respiratory tract following lung transplantation we carried out metagenomic analysis of allograft bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), and compared to healthy and HIV+ subjects. Viral concentrates were purified from BAL and analyzed by shotgun DNA sequencing. All of the BAL samples contained reads mapping to anelloviruses, with high proportions in lung transplant samples. Anellovirus populations in transplant recipients were complex, with multiple concurrent variants. Q-PCR quantification revealed that anellovirus sequences were 56-fold more abundant in BAL from lung transplant recipients compared with healthy controls or HIV+ subjects (p<0.0001). Anellovirus sequences were also more abundant in upper respiratory tract specimens from lung transplant recipients than controls (p=0.006). Comparison to metagenomic data on bacterial populations showed that high anellovirus loads correlated with dysbiotic bacterial communities in allograft BAL (p=0.00816). Thus the respiratory tracts of lung transplant recipients contain high levels and complex populations of anelloviruses, warranting studies of anellovirus lung infection and transplant outcome.

ERP016137	Postglacial viability and colonization in North America's ice-free corridor	During the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) continental ice sheets isolated Beringia (northeast Siberia and northwest North America) from unglaciated North America. By ~15-14 thousand years ago (cal. kyr BP), glacial retreat opened a 1,500-km-long corridor between the ice sheets. It remains unclear when plants and animals colonized this corridor and it became biologically viable for human migration. We obtained radiocarbon dates, pollen, macrofossils and metagenomic DNA from lake sediment cores in a bottleneck portion of the corridor. We find evidence of steppe vegetation, bison and mammoth by ~12.6 cal. kyr BP, followed by open forest, with evidence of moose and elk at ~11.5 cal. kyr BP, and boreal forest ~10 cal. kyr BP. Our findings reveal that the first Americans, whether Clovis or earlier groups in unglaciated North America before 12.6 cal. kyr BP, are unlikely to have travelled this route into the Americas. However, later groups may have used this north-south passageway.

SRP116039	Healthy human fecal metagenomes variably reactivate Irinotecan active metabolite	It is well appreciated that metabolism of irinotecan by the gut microbiota can influence efficacy and potentially produce patient-specific adverse drug responses. However, a direct connection between irinotecan metabollism and the composition of an individualâ€™s gut microbiota has not previously been made. Here, we report the first quantitative evidence of inter-individual variability in microbiome metabolism of the inactive metabolite of irinotecan, a first-line chemotherapeutic for metastatic colorectal cancer, to its active form. We identify a high turnover microbiota metabotype with potentially elevated risk for irinotecan-dependent adverse drug responses. We link the high turnover metabotype to previously unreported microbial ÃŸ-glucuronidases and suggest that inhibiting these enzymes therapeutically may decrease irinotecan-dependent adverse drug responses in targeted subsets of patients. In total, this study demonstrates that metagenomic mining of the microbiome, when combined with metabolomics, defines a non-invasive approach to develop biomarkers for colorectal cancer treatment outcomes.

In cancer samples from both a discovery and a subsequent confirmation cohort, abundance of Firmicutes (especially Streptococcus) and Actinobacteria (especially Rothia) was significantly decreased relative to contralateral normal samples from the same patient.  Significant decreases in abundance of these phyla were observed for pre-cancers, but not when comparing samples from contralateral sites (tongue and floor of mouth) from healthy individuals.  Weighted UniFrac principal coordinates analysis based on 12 taxa separated most cancers from other samples with greatest separation of node positive cases.  These studies begin to develop a framework for exploiting the oral microbiome for monitoring oral cancer development, progression and recurrence.

SRP083290	rock metagenome Metagenome	The Santa Elena Ophiolite comprises 250 km2 of ultramafic rocks and mafic associations along the northwestern Pacific coast of Costa Rica. Uplifted ultramafic rocks originating from the Earthâ€™s mantle represent a reservoir of carbon and reducing power, which during the process of serpentinization, are liberated into the surface environment, potentially supporting microbial growth. The extremely variable weather conditions that occur on the Santa Elena Peninsula between the wet (May â€“ October) and dry (November â€“ April) seasons result in a unique hydrogeological environment. Contrary to other continental serpentinization environments (e.g., Tablelands, Canada; Western Coastal Range, USA; Gruppo di Voltri, Italy), in this tropical scenario, precipitation quantities and intensities are usually greater and occur during extended periods of times, which facilitate infiltration, accelerating water-rock interactions and liberating carbon and energy to the surface environment. These extreme seasonal events provide a unique opportunity to investigate the response of microbial metabolisms (at the interface of deep carbon and energy fluxes) under a dynamic subsurface hydrology setting. During an expedition in March 2013, a series of alkaline springs along the peninsula were sampled. Preliminary V4-V5 sequence data suggests that these fluids had low diversity and that indicated the presence of microorganisms involved in hydrogen, methane, and methanol metabolism (Sanchez-Murillo, et al. unpublished), including bacteria from the genera Hydrogenophaga and Methylibium and from the family Methylophilaceae, as well as archaea from the orders Methanobacteriales, Methanocellales and Methanomicrobiales. In this proposal we intend to demonstrate the links between geochemistry, hydrology, and microbial activities related to subsurface processes at Santa Elena Ophiolite.

SRP001168	Runting-Stunting poultry disease overview	Set of metagenomes to investigate the ethiology of the Runting-Stunting poultry disease.   One day old specific pathogen-free broilers (USDA-ARS, SEPRL, Athens, GA) were orally infected with 1 ml of gut content from 12-day-old commercial broiler chickens which showed the typical signs of runting-stunting-syndrome (RSS) in chicken (growth retardation > 40%, cystic lesions in the small intestine). Before inoculation, the gut content of RSS affected chicken was centrifuged at 4Â°C for 30 min at 3000 x g. the obtained supernatant was filtered first through a 0.45 mkm filter followed by filtration through a 0.22 um filter. A second group of broilers was mock-infected with phosphate buffered saline. Five days, 8 d, and 12 d after infection, 10 birds of each group were euthanized and necropsy was performed. The duodenal loop was taken for histological examination. The analysis of the sections showed that cystic lesions were only present in the infected group. The highest number of lesions was observed at 8 d after infection. Based on this result the gut content harvested at 5 d after infection was used for subsequent experiments.    The purification of the gut content was performed following a multi-step centrifugation protocol. In a first step, the samples were centrifuged at 16000 x g to remove cellular organelles and debris. The obtained supernatant was filtered twice as described above. Next the filtrate was centrifuged through a 10% sucrose cushion made in TEN buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.5) at 174899 x g for 3h. The obtained pellets (RSS+, RSS-) were resuspended in 400 mkl TEN buffer. To purify nucleic acids, the RNA and DNA localized outside of viral particles needed to be degraded. To this end, 40 mkl of 10x DNA I buffer (Roche), 20 units of DNase I (Roche) and 10 ug of RNase I (Roche) was added to 360 mkl of the viral suspension. The mixture was incubated for 1 h at 37C. Both samples (RSS+, Con) were then split and 200 mkl of each sample was used for purification of either the DNA (QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit, Qiagen) or RNA (High Pure RNA isolation Kit, Roche) following the manufacturers instructions. The resulting samples (RSS+ RNA, RSS- RNA, RSS+ DNA and RSS- DNA) were amplified separately using two different protocols to amplify the metagenome (called respectively ChickenRuntingStuntingPRnaVir2008, ChickenRuntingStuntingMRnaVir2008, ChickenRuntingStuntingPDnaVir2008 and ChickenRuntingStuntingMDnaVir2008). The RNA containing samples were amplified using the Transplex Whole Transcriptome Amplification Kit (Sigma). The amplification of the DNA library for both DNA samples was performed using GenomiPhi V2 DNA Amplification Kit (GE Healthcare). Both protocols were applied as recommended by the manufacturer. The resulting cDNA library was submitted to 454 Life Science for sequencing using the GS-FLX platform. Duplicate sequences were removed.	SRR027046
SRP036162	Continental sampling of fungi Targeted Locus (Loci)	We assayed soils from 47 sites in North and South America. The sites represented a wide range in latitude (28 Â°S to 69 Â°N), mean annual temperature (â€“9.3 to 25.0 Â°C), and mean annual precipitation (150 to 5000 mm y-1). The top 5 cm of mineral soil was composited from 5â€“10 locations within a given site, near the peak plant growing season. These soil samples (and their ID numbers) were identical to a subset of those reported in Fierer and Jackson (2006). DNA was extracted from 5â€“10 g dry wt of each soil sample. We used universal fungal primers of Borneman & Hartin (2000) modified for barcoded pyrosequencing to amplify a ~422 bp region of the 18S rRNA gene.

ERP005472	New molecular technique that enables the enrichment of uracil-containing DNA molecules during library preparation.	Contamination with present-day human and microbial DNA is one of the major hindrances for large-scale genomic studies using ancient biological material. We describe a new molecular method, U selection, which exploits one of the most distinctive feature of ancient DNA, the presence of deoxyuracils, for selective enrichment of endogenous DNA against a complex background of contamination at the stage of DNA library preparation. By applying the method to Neanderthal DNA extracts that are heavily contaminated with present-day human DNA, we show that the amount of useful sequence information is increased approximately 10-fold and that the resulting sequences are more efficiently depleted of contaminants than by using purely computational approaches. Furthermore, we show that U selection can lead to a substantial increase in the proportion of endogenous DNA sequences relative to those of microbial contaminants.	ERR472931

ERP016063	Daisy Lake Shotgun Test	Organic matter (OM) derived from terrestrial ecosystems influences both the food webs and biogeochemical cycles of lakes. The boreal ecozone holds an estimated 60% of the worldâ€™s fresh water, but lakes in this region tend to be nutrient-poor and less productive, making them especially reliant on carbon subsidies from riparian litterfall. The availability of these carbon subsidies for aquatic food webs depends on microbial communities, but little is known about how the taxonomic and functional diversity of heterotrophic bacteria might influence the rate at which this OM is decomposed in natural systems. Drawing upon biodiversity-ecosystem functioning theory, we predicted that decomposition rates, indicative of both food web production and whole-lake carbon cycling, increase with the taxonomic and functional diversity of bacterial communities. We characterized both bacterial community composition and microbial functional traits in nearshore sediments from 8 catchments along a gradient of terrestrial OM inputs using next-generation sequencing (16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and shotgun metagenomics). We found that both species richness and composition explained variation in rates of OM decomposition among sites. Differences in species composition were largely driven by 17 bacterial families, with abundances of Acidobacteria, Firmicutes and Actinobacteria changing along OM gradients. Ongoing shotgun sequencing will provide more detailed information on the functional traits present in lake sediments. This study highlights the role of microbial communities in the transfer of resources from terrestrial ecosystems, and improves our understanding of how catchment disturbances affect boreal aquatic ecosystems.

SRP002017	The Metagenome of the deep chlorophyll maximum in the Mediterranean studied by direct and fosmid library 454 pyrosequencing	The Deep Chlorophyll Maximum (DCM) is a zone of maximal photosynthetic activity, generally located towards the base of the photic zone in lakes and oceans. The DCM  in the Mediterranean is a seasonal phenomenon. The metagenome from a single sample of a mature Mediterranean DCM community has been 454 pyrosequenced both directly and after cloning in fosmids. The comparison between the two approaches  revealed a bias in the fosmid libraries against low GC DNA and specifically against the two most dominant members of the community, Candidatus Pelagibacter and Prochlorococcus marinus subsp. pastoris, thus unexpectedly providing a feasible method to obtain large genomic fragments from other less prevalent members of this community. This study is the first to be carried out at this sequencing depth (ca. 600 Mbp combining direct and fosmid sequencing) at any DCM. Our results indicate a microbial community massively dominated by the high-light adapted P. marinus subsp. pastoris, Synechococcus sp. and the heterotroph Candidatus Pelagibacter. The sequences retrieved were remarkably similar to the existing genome of P. marinus subsp. pastoris with a nucleotide identity over 98%. Besides, we found a large number of cyanophages that could prey on this microbe although sequence conservation was much lower. The high abundance of phage sequences in the cellular size fraction indicated a remarkably high proportion of cells suffering phage lytic attack. In addition, several fosmids clearly belonging to Group II Euryarchaeota were retrieved and recruited many fragments from the total DNA sequencing suggesting that this group might be quite abundant in this habitat.

ERP005999	Analysis of metagenome in a full scale tannery wastewater treatment	Bioaugmentation of tannery wastewater was effective in industrial scale using the novel consortium BM-S-1. The aim of this study was to explore the structure of the microbial communities and the functional genes involved in the nitrogen removal. We used Illumina MiSeq Sequencer to conduct metagenome sequencing of microbial communities in the different stages of the treatment including buffering (B), primary aeration (PA), secondary aeration (SA) and sludge digestion (SD). The analysis of metagenome bioinformatic analysis demonstrated that four phyla Proteobacteria, Bacteriodetes, Firmicutes and Actinobacteria were dominant in the treatment process. The dominant genera were Burkholderia, Polaromonas, Albidiferax, Acidovorax, Geobacter, Dechloromonas, Pseudomonas, Rhodopseudomonas and others. Genes associated Nitrogen (N) metabolism were identified. Ssuch genesas gGlutamate synthase (GS), glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH), nitric oxide reductase (NIOR), nNitrous oxide reductase (NOOR), nitrate reductase (NAR), NAD.P.H nitrite reductase (NNIR), and fFerredoxin subunit nitrite reductase (FSNIR) were relatively dictateddetected. The frequency of gGlutamate synthase (GS), glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH), nNitrous oxide reductase (NOOR) and nitrate reductase(NAR) were higher in several genera than nitric oxide reductase (NIOR), NAD.P.H nitrite reductase (NNIR) and fFerredoxin subunit nitrite reductase (FSNIR) in the treatment process. The abundance of some genera associated with nitrogen metabolism and the higher frequency of genes relating nitrogen removal were mostly detected in PA and B corroborated with the high T-N removal in these two stages during the treatment process. These results indicate that a detailed nitrogen metabolism analysis of each treatment process could provide insight into the taxonomy and functions of the microbial biomass involved in nitrogen removal from the tannery wastewater.

SRP008111	The impact of a consortium of fermented milk strains on the gut microbiome of gnotobiotic mice and monozygotic twins. (COPRO-Seq)	Understanding how the human gut microbiota and host are impacted by probiotic bacterial strains requires carefully controlled studies in humans, and in mouse models of the gut ecosystem where potentially confounding variables that are difficult to control in humans can be constrained. Therefore, we characterized the fecal microbiomes and metatranscriptomes of adult female monozygotic twin pairs through repeated sampling 4 weeks prior to, 7 weeks during, and 4 weeks following consumption of a commercially-available fermented milk product (FMP) containing a consortium of Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis, two strains of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, and Streptococcus thermophilus. In addition, gnotobiotic mice harboring a 15-species model human gut microbiota whose genomes contain 58,399 known or predicted protein-coding genes were studied prior to and after gavage with all five sequenced FMP strains. Overall design: 140 samples total.  Evaluation of changes in a model community''s structure over time after exposure to a consortium of 5 fermented milk product (FMP) strains.

Natural geothermal springs represent a unique and extreme environment with adverse conditions of temperature and salinity. Here, a metagenome-based approach was selected to analyze microbiome inhabiting bubbling water samples of a geothermal spring having highest temperature across India. Analysis of community DNA showed that the phyla Proteobacteria, Thermi, Actinobacteria, Crenarchaeota and Bacteroidetes were most abundant. Functional analysis revealed high enrichment of genes for repair system and homologous recombination suggesting that the microbial communities thriving in such an extreme environment have evolved extensive DNA repair systems to withstand high temperature. Also, a de novo genotype of Emticicia oligotrophica strain MM was reconstructed and validated from metagenomic reads.	ERR1846294,ERR1846295

ERP003671	Deep Illumina-based shotgun sequencing reveals dietary effects on the structure and function of the faecal microbiome of growing kittens	Despite being obligate carnivores, cats are fed a wide range of dietary macronutrients within commercial diets. Little is known regarding the feline gastrointestinal microbiome and how it is impacted by diet. Using 16S RNA analysis, changes in diet (protein:carbohydrate ratio) do affect fecal microbiota of growing kittens. However, to investigate potential functional differences deep Illumina shotgun sequencing is required and a study of microbial structure and function in these animals is reported here.  This is the largest and most comprehensive analysis of the feline gastrointestinal microbiome to date. It provides an overview of the taxa and gene functions present and how they are impacted by the dietary protein: carbohydrate ratio. The more diverse structure of the high-protein diet might reflect a more specialized microbiome. As anticipated, our permutation approach reduced the number of pathways to a more manageable set. The reduced data set identified six pathways readily interpretable to the study design.

ERP010448	A longitudinal study of the feline faecal microbiome identifies changes into early adulthood irrespective of sexual development	Companion animals provide an excellent model for studies of the gut microbiome because potential confounders such as diet and environment can be more readily controlled for than in humans. Additionally, domestic cats and dogs are typically neutered early in life, enabling an investigation into the potential effect of sex hormones on the microbiome. In a longitudinal study to investigate the potential effects of neutering, neutering age and gender on the gut microbiome during growth, the faeces of kittens (16 male, 14 female) were sampled at 18, 30 and 42 weeks of age. DNA was shotgun sequenced on the Illumina platform and sequence reads were annotated for taxonomy and function by comparison to a database of protein coding genes. In a statistical analysis of diversity, taxonomy and functional potential of the microbiomes, age was revealed as the only factor with significant effects on the variation observed. No significant effects were detected for gender, neutering, or age when neutered (19 or 31 weeks). At 18 weeks of age the microbiome was dominated by the genera Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium (35% and 20% average abundance). Structural and functional diversity was significantly increased by week 30 but there was no further significant increase. At 42 weeks of age the most abundant genera were Bacteroides (16%), Prevotella (14%) and Megasphaera (8%). Significant differences in functional potential included an enrichment for genes in energy metabolism (carbon metabolism and oxidative phosphorylation) and depletion in cell motility (flagella and chemotaxis). We conclude that the feline faecal microbiome is predominantly determined by age when diet and environment are controlled for. We suggest this finding may also be informative for studies of the human microbiome, where control over such factors is usually limited.

NGS of genomic DNA was used to identify putative centromeric repeats, while RNAseq allowed us to identify and characterize the CENH3 gene of Rhynchospora pubera, our model species. An antibody recognizing the holocentromeres of that species was then designed. ChIP-seq was used to validate the association of the centromeric repeat candidates, a satellite DNA (Tyba) and a centromeric retrotransposon (CRRh), to the functional centromeric nucleosomes from a holocentric species. Finally, assembly of sequenced BACs containing Tyba centromeric tandem repeat was used to examine the properties of the multiple centromeric units found.	ERR922049,ERR922050,ERR922051,ERR922052

SRP002523	Metagenomic analysis of viruses in the fecal micorobiota of monozygotic twins and their mothers	The human gut contains our largest collection of viruses, which infect the bacteria, archaea, and small eukaryotes that comprise its microbiota. Viral diversity and lifecycles are poorly understood in this as well as other body habitats. Therefore, we sequenced the viromes (metagnomes) of virus-like particles (VLPs) isolated from fecal samples that were collected from 4 pairs of adult female monozygotic (MZ) twins and their mothers at three different time points over the course of a year. These datasets were compared to datasets of sequenced bacterial 16S rRNA gene amplicons and total fecal community DNA. While our previous metagenomic analyses demonstrated that co-twins and their mothers share a greater degree of similarity in their fecal bacterial communities than unrelated individuals1, the current study shows that viromes, which encode diverse metabolic functions, are unique to individuals regardless of  family relationships. Moreover, viromes are dominated by temperate phage that exhibit remarkable stability over the one year study period. Together these results indicate that the virome is a highly individualistic component of our gut ecosystems, even among people with identical human genotypes.

SRP058955	Phylogenetic and Functional Substrate Specificity for Endolithic Microbial Communities from the Atacama Desert	Under extreme water deficit, rapid thermal fluctuation, and high solar radiation fluxes, endolithic (inhabiting rock) microbial ecosystems are considered environmental refuges for life in cold and hot deserts around the world. Metagenomics analysis of two rock substrates, calcite (calcium carbonate) and ignimbrite (volcanic glass), revealed that the communities were dominated by Cyanobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Chloroflexi, but that the relative distribution of these phyla was significantly different between the two substrates. Biodiversity estimates from 16S rRNA gene sequences and from the metagenome data all pointed to a higher taxonomic diversity for the calcite community. While the functional capabilities of the two communities appeared similar and tailored to the rock environment (photosynthetic-based), pathways for iron and Mn transport, and for osmoregulation were more diverse in the calcite community. These findings likely relate to the large cracks in the calcite rock favoring water retention, the assembly of a more diverse community, and increased interactions among community members. In contrast, the ignimbrite community was enriched in pathways for secondary metabolites, such as non-ribosomal peptides (NRPS) and polyketides (PKS), indicating a harsh competition for space in the narrow pores of the rock. Assemblies of the metagenome data produced population genomes for the major phyla found in both communities and revealed a greater phylogenetic diversity for the calcite Cyanobacteria population genomes. Draft genomes of the dominant Cyanobacteria in each community were constructed with more than 93% estimated completeness. The two annotated proteomes shared 64% amino acid identity but a significant higher number of clusters for NRPS and PKS were found in the ignimbrite draft genome. Together, these results indicate that the architecture of the rock substrate might be an essential element in determining the colonization, and the diversity, of the microbial communities in endolithic substrates at the dry limit for life.

SRP013340	Xenobiotics shape the physiology and gene expression of the active human gut microbiome	The human gut is colonized by trillions of microorganisms that influence human health and disease through the metabolism of xenobiotics, including therapeutic drugs and antibiotics. The diversity and metabolic potential of the human gut microbiome have been extensively characterized, but it remains unclear which microorganisms are active and which perturbations can influence this activity. Here, we use flow cytometry, 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and metatranscriptomics to demonstrate that the human gut contains distinctive subsets of active and damaged microorganisms, primarily composed of Firmicutes, which display marked temporal variation. Short-term exposure to a panel of xenobiotics resulted in significant changes in the physiology and gene expression of this active microbiome. Xenobiotic-responsive genes were found across multiple bacterial phyla, encoding novel candidate proteins for antibiotic resistance, drug metabolism, and stress response. These results demonstrate the power of moving beyond DNA-based measurements of microbial communities to better understand their physiology and metabolism. Overall design: RNA-Seq analysis of the human gut microbiome during exposure to antibiotics and therapeutic drugs.	SRR500039,SRR500057,SRR500069,SRR500090,SRR500099,SRR500115

ERP001779	Microbial biogeography of public restroom surfaces	We spend the majority of our lives indoors where we are constantly exposed to bacteria residing on surfaces. However, the diversity of these surface-associated communities is largely unknown. We explored the biogeographical patterns exhibited by bacteria across ten surfaces within each of twelve public restrooms. Using high-throughput barcoded pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA gene, we identified 19 bacterial phyla across all surfaces. Most sequences belonged to four phyla: Actinobacteria, Bacteriodetes, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria. The communities clustered into three general categories: those found on surfaces associated with toilets, those on the restroom floor, and those found on surfaces routinely touched with hands. On toilet surfaces, gut-associated taxa were more prevalent, suggesting fecal contamination of these surfaces. Floor surfaces were the most diverse of all communities and contained several taxa commonly found in soils. Skin-associated bacteria, especially the Propionibacteriaceae, dominated surfaces routinely touched with our hands. Certain taxa were more common in female than in male restrooms as vagina-associated Lactobacillaceae were widely distributed in female restrooms, likely from urine contamination. Use of the SourceTracker algorithm confirmed many of our taxonomic observations as human skin was the primary source of bacteria on restroom surfaces. Overall, these results demonstrate that restroom surfaces host relatively diverse microbial communities dominated by human-associated bacteria with clear linkages between communities on or in different body sites and those communities found on restroom surfaces. More generally, this work is relevant to the public health field as we show that human associated microbes are commonly found on restroom surfaces suggesting that bacterial pathogens could readily be transmitted between individuals by the touching of surfaces. Furthermore, we demonstrate that we can use high-throughput analyses of bacterial communities to determine sources of bacteria on indoor surfaces, an approach which could be used to track pathogen transmission and test the efficacy of hygiene practices.

ERP001227	Substrate-controlled succession of distinct marine bacterioplankton                 populations induced by a spring phytoplankton bloom	Phytoplankton blooms characterize temperate ocean margin zones in spring                 and contribute substantially to their high productivity. We investigated the                 bacterioplankton response to a diatom bloom in the North Sea and observed an as yet                 unseen dynamic succession of thriving populations at genus level resolution.                 Taxonomically distinct expressions of carbohydrate-active enzymes, transporters (in                 particular TonB-dependent transporters) and phosphate acquisition systems were                 found, indicating that distinct populations of Bacteroidetes, Gammaproteobacteria                 and Alphaproteobacteria acted like guilds specialized for successive algal-derived                 organic matter decomposition. Our results suggest that algal substrate availability                 and bacterial ecological niches determined the succession. A better understanding of                 such couplings between bacterioplankton and phytoplankton is needed to pave the way                 for predictive models of bacterioplankton bloom dynamics and thus more accurate                 global carbon turnover balances.

DRP001053	Comparative metagenome analyses of anode-associated microbial communities developed in rice paddy field-soil microbial fuel cells	Sediment-type microbial fuel cells (sMFCs) can be operated in rice paddy fields, in which rice-root exudates are converted to electricity by anode-associated rhizosphere microbes. Previous studies have suggested members of the family Geobacteraceae being enriched on anodes of rhizosphere sMFCs. In order to deepen our understanding of rhizosphere microbes involved in electricity generation in sMFCs, the present study conducted comparative analyses of anode-associated microbes in three MFCs; namely, sMFC installed in a rice paddy field, and acetate- and glucose-fed MFC reactors in which pieces of anode graphite felts that had cut from a rice paddy-field sMFC were used as microbe-bearing anodes. After electric outputs became stable, microbial communities established in association with anodes of these MFCs and that in bulk soil were comparatively analyzed by pyrotag sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons and Illumina shotgun metagenomics. The pyrotag sequencing showed the presence of Geobacteraceae bacteria in association with the anodes, while types of Geobacter that grew in these MFCs were different. Namely, those closely related to G. metallireducens shared 90% of the anode Geobacteraceae in the acetate-fed MFC, while, in the rhizosphere sMFC and glucose-fed MFC, such Geobacteraceae sequences were minor, and those closely related to G. psychrophilus were abundantly detected. This trend was also confirmed by phylogenetic assignments of genes predicted in shotgun metagenome sequences of the anode communities. We suggest that G. psychrophilus relatives preferentially grow on anodes of rhizosphere sMFCs and generate electricity under syntrophic interactions with organisms excreting electron donors.

ERP013933	Reproducibility of associations between the human gut microbiome and colorectal cancer assessed in a patient population from Washington, DC, USA	Accumulating evidence indicates that the gut microbiota affects colorectal cancer development, but previous studies have varied in population, technical methods, and associations with cancer. Understanding these variations is needed for comparisons and for potential pooling across studies. Therefore, we performed whole-genome shotgun metagenomics sequencing on fecal samples from 52 pre-treatment colorectal cancer cases and 52 matched controls from Washington, DC. We compared findings from a previous 16S rRNA study to the metagenomics-derived taxonomy within the same population. In addition, metagenome-predicted genes, modules, and pathways in the Washington, DC cases and controls were compared to cases and controls recruited in France whose specimens were processed using the same platform. Associations between the presence of fecal Fusobacteria, Fusobacterium, and Porphyromonas with colorectal cancer detected by 16S rRNA were reproduced by metagenomics, whereas higher relative abundance of Clostridia in cancer cases based on 16S rRNA was merely borderline based on metagenomics. Considering significant cancer associations with the relative abundance of genes, modules, and pathways in the French population, statistically significant associations in the Washington, DC population were detected for four out of 10 genes, three out of nine modules, and seven out of 17 pathways. In conclusion, metagenomic sequencing results reproduced most, but not all of the major taxonomic associations with colorectal cancer previously observed from 16S rRNA profiles. In addition, colorectal cancer in the Washington, DC study was associated with 39% of the metagenome-predicted genes, modules, and pathways identified from the French study. More within and between population comparisons are needed to identify sources of variation and disease associations that can be reproduced despite these variations.

ERP006800	Trans-kingdom control of microbiota diurnal oscillations promotes metabolic homeostasis	All domains of life feature diverse molecular clock machineries that synchronize physiological processes to diurnal environmental fluctuations. However, no mechanisms are known to cross-regulate prokaryotic and eukaryotic circadian rhythms in multi-kingdom ecosystems. Here, we show that the intestinal microbiota, in both mice and humans, exhibits diurnal oscillations that are influenced by feeding rhythms, leading to time-specific compositional and functional profiles over the course of a day. Ablation of host molecular clock components or induction of jet lag leads to aberrant microbiota diurnal fluctuations and dysbiosis, driven by impaired feeding rhythmicity. Consequently, jet lag-induced dysbiosis in both mice and humans promotes glucose intolerance and obesity that are transferrable to germ-free mice upon fecal transplantation. Together, these findings provide the first evidence of coordinated meta-organism diurnal rhythmicity, and offer a microbiome-dependent mechanism for common metabolic disturbances in humans with aberrant circadian rhythms, such as those documented in shift workers and frequent flyers.

SRP094805	human gut metagenome in RA	Gut microbiome make contributions to human host, and intestinal dysbiosis is associated with rheumatoid arthritis. Here we firstly demonstrated that the human gut microbiome related to rheumatoid arthritis could be divided into subtyping groups under different human enterotypes, which indicate the associations between rheumatoid arthritis and gut microbiome were diverse. In rheumatoid arthritis-related microbiota, Prevotella could be an indicator of early rheumatoid arthritis patients but insufficient to differentiate RA patients from healthy controls, and Bacteroides coprocola enriched in group 3 and Bacteroides dorei enriched in group 4 were considered to be as indicators of serious rheumatoid arthritis patients. Our findings provide additional evidences supporting that rheumatoid arthritis is a heterogeneous disease. Thus, the study of association between disease and gut microbiome should be conducted under different human gut enterotypes.

ERP002478	Song_2012_family_study	Human-associated microbial community composition is highly variable across host individuals, but the sources of this variability remain poorly understood. Previous studies have explored some possible contributing factors such as (genetic) relatedness, diet, and developmental stage. A likely additional cause is that our microbial communities are shaped by our unique surroundings, including the individuals with whom we interact at various stages of life. To quantify potential microbial exchange, we surveyed fecal, oral, and skin microbiota from 159 humans and 36 dogs across 60 families consisting of spousal units with children, dogs, both, or neither. Members of the same family, particularly couples, shared more of their microbiota than did individuals from different households, with an especially strong effect of co-habitation on skin compared to oral or fecal microbiota. Dog ownership, but not children, had a significant effect on the extent to which cohabiting adults shared skin (forehead and palm) microbiota, and dog-owning adults shared more microbial taxa with each other than with those who did not. Furthermore, adults shared more skin microbiota with their own dogs than with other dogs. These results suggest that direct and frequent contact with our cohabitants may significantly shape the composition of our microbial communities.	ERR262823

SRP064383	Pollen forage of honey bees Targeted loci environmental	In light of recent pollinator declines and potential loss of pollination services, the has been increased basic and applied research on pollinator systems. Sequencing of phylogenetically informative â€œbarcodeâ€ genetic loci has emerged over the past two decades as a robust tool for taxonomic classification that often achieves higher resolution than morphological or other classification methods. More recently, high-throughput sequencing has allowed â€œmeta-barcodingâ€ analysis of diverse mixtures, and this approach has begun to be applied to bee-collected. Here we develop a sequencing approach that differs from other approaches in the sequence that was analyzed, the use of a higher-capacity platform with more flexible multiplexing, and/or the development of a workflow for non-overlapping read pairs.

SRP001993	Development and quantitative analyses of a universal rRNA-subtraction protocol for microbial metatranscriptomics	Metatranscriptomes generated by pyrosequencing hold significant potential for describing  functional processes in complex microbial communities. Meeting this potential requires protocols  that maximize mRNA recovery by reducing the relative abundance of ribosomal RNA, as well as  systematic comparisons to identify methodological artifacts and test for reproducibility across data  sets. Here, we implement a protocol for subtractive hybridization of bacterial rRNA (16S and 23S)  that uses sample-specific probes and is applicable across diverse environmental samples. To test  this method, rRNA-subtracted and unsubtracted transcriptomes were sequenced (454 FLX  technology) from bacterioplankton communities at two depths in the oligotrophic open ocean,  yielding 10 data sets representing B350 Mbp. Subtractive hybridization reduced bacterial rRNA  transcript abundance by 40â€“58%, increasing recovery of non-rRNA sequences up to fourfold (from  12% to 20% of total sequences to 40â€“49%). In testing this method, we established criteria for  detecting sequences replicated artificially via pyrosequencing errors and identified such replicates  as a significant component (6â€“39%) of total pyrosequencing reads. Following replicate removal,  statistical comparisons of reference genes (identified via BLASTX to NCBI-nr) between technical  replicates and between rRNA-subtracted and unsubtracted samples showed low levels of differential  transcript abundance (o0.2% of reference genes). However, gene overlap between data sets was  remarkably low, with no two data sets (including duplicate runs from the same pyrosequencing  library template) sharing greater than 17% of unique reference genes. These results indicate that  pyrosequencing captures a small subset of total mRNA diversity and underscores the importance of  reliable rRNA subtraction procedures to enhance sequencing coverage across the functional  transcript pool.

In addition to the diet and living habits related non-mammalian viruses such as insect viruses, fungal viruses, plant viruses, and phages, we outline the spectrums of mammalian viruses (including Viruses under the families Herpesviridae, Picobirnaviridae, Anelloviridae, Circoviridae, Retroviridae, Astroviridae, Coronaviridae, Adenoviridae, Poxviridae, Papillomaviridae, Reoviridae, Arenaviridae, Arteriviridae, Bunyaviridae, Caliciviridae, Flaviviridae, Hepeviridae, Caliciviridae, Rhabdoviridae, Paramyxoviridae and Picornaviridae and the subfamily Parvovirinae) within these 3,005 small animal individuals and the basic ecological and genetic characteristics of many novel viruses out of the viral spectrums. Genetic evidences obtained in this study provides new clues in the search for the origin or evolution pattern of certain viruses, such as hantavirus, arterivirus, and coronavirus.

The interest in biological communities associated with these environments have increased in the last decades, however little is known about microbial community structure, that may have a key role in soil processes and plant community development. In the present study we aimed to analyze microbial community composition in anthrosols from road embankments, as well as the relevant scale for community self-organization.	ERR424646,ERR424699

ERP010839	Dissecting effects of community context on a gut pathobiont in a model of childhood undernutrition	To model how interactions between enteropathogens and gut microbial community members contribute to undernutrition, we colonized gnotobiotic mice fed representative Bangladeshi diets with sequenced bacterial strains cultured from fecal microbiota of 24-month-old Bangladeshis: one healthy, the other severely stunted/underweight. The undernourished donorâ€™s collection contained an enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis strain (ETBF), while the healthy donorâ€™s collection contained two nontoxigenic strains (NTBF). Analyses of mice harboring either the unmanipulated culture collections or systematically manipulated versions revealed that ETBF was causally related to weight loss in the context of its native community, but not when introduced into the healthy donorâ€™s community. This phenotype was transmissible from mothers to offspring and associated with derangements in host energy metabolism manifest by impaired TCA cycle activity and decreased acyl-CoA utilization. NTBF reduced ETBF expression of its enterotoxin and mitigated its effects on other healthy donor community membersâ€™ transcriptomes. These results illustrate how intraspecific (ETBF-NTBF) and interspecific interactions impact the effects of harboring this pathobiont.

SRP002729	Bloomer DOM addition experiment	To better define the processes and population dynamics associated with marine microbial DOM cycling in ocean surface waters, we performed controlled experiments using seawater microcosms amended with freshly prepared, naturally occurring DOM.  High molecular weight DOM (HMWDOM), was prepared by ultrafiltration using a 1 nm membrane filter, followed by a second filtration step to remove viruses.  Whole, unfiltered seawater  was distributed into replicate microcosms (20L each), that were incubated at in situ temperatures and light intensities. The ambient concentration of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the unamended microcosms was 82 *M DOC, while the HMWDOM-amended microcosms contained 328 *M DOC, representing a 4-fold increase in over ambient DOC concentrations.  Control (no addition) and experimental (DOM amended) microcosms were sampled at 0 hr, 2 hr, 12 hr and 27 hr time points and extracted for DNA and RNA, and the resulting DNA and cDNA produced was pyrosequenced.

SRP083090	Soudan Iron Mine Metagenome	Embedded deep within northern Minnesotaâ€™s expansive Iron Range, the Soudan Iron Mine (47Â°49'24? N, 92Â°14'14? W) transects massive veins of hematite and Archaean (2.7 Gy) banded iron formations, reaching a depth of 713 m (2,341 ft) below the surface. Now an actively maintained State Park serving to preserve Minnesotaâ€™s oldest and deepest underground mine, Soudan provides year-round access to the deep terrestrial subsurface and the unique microbial communities it hosts. Before mining ceased in 1962, vertical and horizontal exploratory cores were taken at its lowest level (Level 27, 713 m depth) to track the iron formation. Today these boreholes act as conduits for anoxic, low flow, saline groundwater in an otherwise dry mine. Calcium chloride brines emanate from seeps with ionic strengths up to three times saltier than seawater, low oxidation-reduction potentials, circumneutral pH, and low concentrations of organic electron donors. Despite carbon limitation, anoxic brines contain reduced metals and continuously evolve methane gas, raising questions about the microbes responsible for primary production and carbon flux in this subsurface ecosystem.

ERP015025	Genome data on the extinct Bison schoetensacki establish it as a sister species of the extant European bison (Bison bonasus)	The European bison (Bison bonasus), now found in Europe and the Caucasus, has been proposed to originate either from the extinct steppe/extant American bison lineage or from the extinct Bison schoetensacki lineage. Bison schoetensacki remains are documented in Eurasian Middle Pleistocene sites, but their presence in Upper Pleistocene sites has been questioned. Despite extensive genetic studies carried out on the steppe and European bison, no remains from the fossil record morphologically identified as Bison schoetensacki has been analyzed up to now. In this paper, we analyzed a 36,000-year-old Bison schoetensaki bone sample from the Sirejol cave (France) and a cave hyena coprolite (fossilized feces) found in a nearby cave and containing large amounts of Bovinae DNA. We show that the Bovinae mitochondrial DNA sequences from both samples, including a complete mitochondrial genome sequence, belong to a clade recently reported in the literature. This clade only includes ancient bison specimens without taxonomic identification and displays a sister relationship with the extant European bison. The genetic proximity of Bison schoetensacki with specimens from this clade is corroborated by the analysis of nuclear DNA single nucleotide polymorphisms. This work provides genetic evidence supporting the continuing presence of Bison schoetensacki up to the Upper Pleistocene. Bison schoetensacki turns out to be a sister species of Bison bonasus, excluding the steppe bison Bison priscus as a direct ancestor of the European bison.

SRP092195	Programmed cell death in the Ross Sea	The Southern Ocean plays a critical role for carbon sequestration in the oceans. The flux of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) export to the deep ocean depends on the efficiency of the biological pump transporting biomass to depth, however the molecular mechanisms are not well understood. This study focuses on the impact of microbial communities in the C flux in the Ross Sea observed in the late austral summer of 2013 during the TRacing Algal Carbon Export in the Ross Sea (TRACERS) expedition. Programmed cell death (PCD) modulates the turnover of phytoplankton in the oceans, however few field data exist to demonstrate this phenomenon. We have characterized at taxonomical and functional level the primary groups of organisms undergoing PCD in the water column. PCD was observed to occur in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, which dominated different regions and depths in the water column, specifically, we found Pelagibacter, Tenacibaculum and Psychrobacter as representative genera of the Bacteria, and Stylonychia, Emiliania and Chaetoceros of the Eukarya domain respectively. We observed higher occurrences of eukaryotic cells to undergo PCD in surface waters of a diatom bloom in the western Ross Sea, while prokaryotes undergoing PCD were found deeper in the water column and in regions outside of the bloom. We will also present new mechanistic insights about differentially active pathways among diatoms undergoing PCD. Finally, we discuss how PCD contributes to the production of free and assemble polymers gels, thus influencing carbon export.

ERP004763	S. cerevisiae WT vs snf2 KO mutant RNA-seq data with 7 technical and 48 biological replicates (336 total) of each condition	High-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is now the standard method to determine differential gene expression.  Here, a 48 replicate, two condition RNA-seq experiment was designed specifically to test assumptions about RNA-seq read count variability models and the performance of methods for differential gene expression analysis by RNA-seq.   Samples were run on an Illumina HiSeq for 50 cycles single-end and included ERCC RNA spike-ins. The high-replicate data allowed for strict quality control and screening of 'bad' replicates.  The experiment allowed the effect of bad replicates to be assessed as well as providing guidelines for the number of replicates required for differential gene expression analysis and the most appropriate statistical tools.

SRP017487	soil metagenome Metagenome	Increased exploration and exploitation of resources in the Arctic is leading to a higher risk of petroleum contamination. A number of Arctic microorganisms can use petroleum for growth-supporting carbon and energy, but traditional approaches for stimulating these microorganisms (e.g. nutrient addition) have varied in effectiveness between sites. Consistent environmental controls on microbial community response to disturbance from petroleum contaminants and nutrient amendments across Arctic soils have not been identified, nor is it known whether specific taxa are universally associated with efficient bioremediation. In this study, we contaminated 18 varied Arctic soils with diesel and treated subsamples of each with monoammonium phosphate (MAP). Bacterial community composition of uncontaminated, diesel-contaminated, and diesel + MAP soils was assessed through multiplexed 16S rRNA gene sequencing on an Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine, while hydrocarbon degradation was measured by GC analysis. The predictability with which bacterial communities respond to these disturbances suggests that costly and time-consuming contaminated site assessments may not be necessary in the future.   Top 15 cm soils collected from across the Arctic, left untreated, or treated with diesel or diesel   nutrients.	SRR640669,SRR640687

ERP016823	Host genotype and gut microbiome modulate insulin secretion and diet-induced metabolic phenotypes	Genetic variation drives phenotypic diversity and determines predisposition to metabolic disease. Host genetics also modulates the composition of the gut microbiota. However, the relative contributions of host vs. microbial genetic variation in the development of diet-induced metabolic phenotypes remain largely unknown. Here, we characterize the metabolic phenotypes of eight genetically distinct inbred mouse strains in response to a western-style high-fat/high-sucrose diet. We found significant variation in diabetes-related phenotypes and gut microbiota composition among the different mouse strains in response to the dietary challenge. Follow-up gnotobiotic mouse experiments showed that altering the composition of the gut microbiota modifies strain-specific susceptibility to diet-induced metabolic disease and insulin secretion. Animals with increased susceptibility to metabolic disease and increased insulin secretion exhibited an enhanced capacity to metabolize dietary sugars, higher levels of short-chain fatty acids and microbiota-derived bile acids (BA), and increased pancreatic gene expression of the BA-dependent regulator and activator of insulin secretion, Fxr. Our results suggest that the gut microbiome contributes to the genetic and phenotypic diversity observed among mouse strains and provide novel mechanistic insights linking microbial metabolism and insulin secretion.

SRP003478	Microbial diversity associated with four functional groups of benthic reef algae and the reef-building coral Montastraea annularis	The coral reef benthos is primarily colonized by corals and algae, which are often in direct competition with one another for space. Numerous studies have shown that coral-associated Bacteria are different from the surrounding seawater and are at least partially species specific (i.e. the same bacterial species on the same coral species). Here we extend these microbial studies to four of the major ecological functional groups of algae found on coral reefs: upright and encrusting calcifying algae, fleshy algae, and turf algae, and compare the results to the communities found on the reef-building coral Montastraea annularis. It was found using 16S rDNA tag pyrosequencing that the different algal genera harbour characteristic bacterial communities, and these communities were generally more diverse than those found on corals. While the majority of coral-associated Bacteria were related to known heterotrophs, primarily consuming carbon-rich coral mucus, algal-associated communities harboured a high percentage of autotrophs. The majority of algal-associated autotrophic Bacteria were Cyanobacteria and may be important for nitrogen cycling on the algae. There was also a rich diversity of photosynthetic eukaryotes associated with the algae, including protists, diatoms, and other groups of microalgae. Together, these observations support the hypothesis that coral reefs are a vast landscape of distinctive microbial communities and extend the holobiont concept to benthic algae.

We and others have shown that the composition of the stool microbiota signatures differ between eczema and healthy controls in infancy. The scope of work will include the identification of functional and structural gene composition present in the stools of infants with and without eczema by comparative metagenomics. The proposed study will provide the initial steps towards a comprehensive evaluation of the bacterial gene composition in stool microbiota in relation to development of eczema.

SRP097175	sediment metagenome Metagenome	Microbial metabolism in the oxic/anoxic transition zones (OATZ) of sediments can serve as a barrier preventing the emission of nutrients and greenhouse gases diffusing upwards to the overlying water column. However, microbial diversity and activities in this transition zone are not well understood. Here we propose to employ metagenomic shotgun DNA sequencing on three representative samples from oligotrophic sediment columns retrieved from North Pond during IODP Expedition 336. These sediments offer a unique opportunity to explore the OATZ in oligotrophic sediments, and are characterized by both an upper a lower OATZ. In short we aim at: elucidating the identity to the owners of functional genes that are not â€œaccountedâ€ for in the 16S rRNA libraries. Investigate the genomic inventory of uncharacterized sedimentary lineages of putative archaeal ammonium oxidizers.

ERP010236	Arsenic response in Coccomyxa sp. deciphered by non-targeted metabolomic and transcriptomic analysis	Arsenic is a toxic metalloid known to generate an important oxidative stress in cells. In the present study we focused our attention on an alga related to the genus Coccomyxa, which was isolated from an acid mine drainage (AMD) presenting very high concentrations of the water soluble form, arsenite. Physiological observations combined with differential transcriptomic and non-targeted metabolomic analyses highlighted multiple levels of protection against this toxic compound. Indeed, Coccomyxa sp. induced a set of transporters potentially preventing the accumulation of this metalloid in the cells and presented a distinct arsenic metabolism in comparison to an other specie more sensitive to that compound, i.e. E. gracilis, especially in regard to arsenic methylation. Surprisingly, Coccomyxa sp. did not seem to be exposed to an important oxidative stress in the presence of arsenite, which is likely linked to intracellular accumulation of high levels of strong antioxidants such as ascorbic acid and glutathione. Our results therefore suggest that this alga has acquired multiple and original defense mechanisms allowing the colonization of extreme ecosystems such as AMDs.

ERP005607	ASS lime injection - injection site	Due to very low inflows from the Murray-Darling Basin from 2007-2009, water levels in the Lower Murray River dropped to -1m AHD in April 2009. The low water levels and restricted water allocations during this hydrological drought period caused the acid sulfate soils subsequently acidified and salinized. Given the acidic drainage water presents a potential risk to the water quality and environmental values of the Lower River Murray, a subsoil neutralisation using a limestone slurry and a modified mole drain technique was applied. The aim of this trial is to examine whether the introduction of alkalinity (limestone) at depth in the oxidised and rewet acid sulfate soils, will sufficiently raise the pH to begin the process of sulfate reduction. It is hoped by promoting sulfate reduction, via sulfate reducing bacteria, the soils will begin to remediate, producing less acidic drainage to the salt drains in the irrigation areas.

SRP070680	Alcanivorax borkumensis isolate:ABS183 Genome sequencing and assembly	Formation of anhydrite crystals may preserve microbial cells and organic matter. In deep-sea sediment, the microbes in the anhydrite crystals after mild hydrothermal activities are markers of the past environment and can probably serve as nutrient reservoir. In this study, this hypothesis was examined by analyzing a metagenome in anhydrite crystals from a hydrothermal and hypersaline sediment core sampled at the Atlantis II Deep of the Red Sea. The 16S/18S rRNA genes in the metagenome were affiliated with Bacteria, Archaea, Fungi and even Arthropoda. The dominant species was alkane-degrading Alkanivorax bacterium, and its draft genome was separated from the metagenome of the anhydrite sample but not from that of the adjacent sediment. Phylogenetic relationship with known species and fluorescent microscope showed that the dominant bacterium in the crystals was a new strain of Alcanivorax borkumensis. The draft genome contains all the functional genes for alkane utilization and reduction of nitrogen oxides. Moreover, there are aromatic degradation pathways in the metagenomes of anhydrites and control sediment, which are mostly derived from Ochrobactrum sp. Estimated age of the anhydrite layer was between 750-770 years, which corresponds to the time of the hydrothermal eruption to the benthic floor and subsurface sediment. The presence of Alkanivorax and Ochrobactrum bacteria and identification of oil degradation genes in the anhydrites indicate the past oil-spilling benthic environment in the Atlantis II basin of the Red Sea. Moreover, increase of organic carbons in the anhydrite layers, compared with approximate layers, is also probably due to the trapped microbes, suggesting that the dissolution of the crystals may bolster the growth of microbial inhabitants.

Paper currency notes are one of the most commonly exchanged objects and its potential to transmit pathogenic organisms has been well recognized. Approaches to identify the resident microbiome of currency notes have been largely limited to culture dependent approaches except for recent reports which have used 16S ribosomal RNA based approaches which provide insights only into the taxonomical distribution of the resident microbiome. Recent techniques including shotgun sequencing provide an advantage of gene level characterization and copy number estimation in metagenome. We studied the resident microbiome using a shotgun metagenome approach. Metagenomic DNA isolated from frequently circulated denominations of Indian currency notes was sequenced using Illumina Hiseq.

SRP109620	The Perioperative Lung Transplant Virome	Primary graft dysfunction (PGD) is a principal cause of early morbidity and mortality after lung transplantation, but its pathogenic mechanisms are not fully clarified. Thus far, studies using standard clinical assays have not linked microbial factors to PGD. We previously used comprehensive metagenomic methods to characterize viruses in lung allografts >1 month post-transplant and found that levels of Anellovirus, mainly Torque teno viruses (TTV), were significantly higher than in non-transplant healthy controls. Here we used quantitative PCR to analyze TTV and shotgun metagenomics to characterize full viral communities in acellular bronchoalveolar lavage from donor organs and post-reperfusion allografts in PGD and non-PGD lung transplant recipient pairs. Unexpectedly, TTV DNA levels were 100-fold elevated in donor lungs compared with healthy adults (p=0.0026). Although absolute TTV levels did not differ by PGD status, PGD cases showed a smaller increase in TTV levels from pre- to post-transplant than did control recipients (p=0.041). Metagenomic sequencing revealed mainly TTV and bacteriophages of respiratory tract bacteria, but no viral taxa distinguished PGD cases from controls. These findings suggest that conditions associated with brain death promote TTV replication, and that greater immune activation or tissue injury associated with PGD may restrict TTV abundance in the lung.

The test requires biological replicates from one sample and additionally multiple technical replicates from each biological replicate. The test is based on a three-way computational comparisons of samples. We collected three biological replicates from different locations of a human stool sample (A, B, and C) to illustrate the application of the test. Each biological replicate is furthermore represented by three technical replicates (A1, A2, A3, B1, B2, B3, C1, C2, and C3).

SRP030216	Biofoam biofilm sample 16S rRNA gene libraries	Small scale biosand filters (BSFs) utilized as point of use (POU) water treatment technologies can provide quality drinking water in arid regions. In this current study, biofilms within a novel biologically active POU technology that removes pathogens from water were studied. The biofilms develop across porous foam cartridge filters termed â€œbiofoam,â€ and were assayed for community membership. Biofilms within the POU filter medium were developed at three different locations in the US using three different surface waters. Biofilm microbial communities that developed on biofoam were analyzed utilizing 454 pyrosequencing of the 16S rDNA genes, and showed a remarkable degree of shared community membership among the three locations. A large, diverse shared microbiome was found as defined by the top 100 shared operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at 0.03 cut off (97% similarity). This represented 280,000 of the 306,000 sequences (>90%). Of those, 25% were classified within the genus Pseudomonas. Members of the microbial communities found within the shared microbiome of the biofoam were closely associated with organisms commonly found in activated sludge, drinking water biofilms, rhizosphere, phyllosphere, and soil ecosystems. The biofoam provides a unique and effective porous matrix for biofilm formation, which appears to allow for the establishment of consistent microbial communities, even when developed at different locations utilizing different water sources. Improving our understanding of the biofoamâ€™s microbial ecology may provide insights into mechanisms of pathogen removal, and allow development of customized biofilms for targeted remediation projects, as part of a lightweight and energy efficient water filtration system.

SRP001120	Metagenome isolated from the soybean phyllosphere	For terrestrial plants, the phyllosphere represents the interface between the above-ground parts of plants and the air. Conservative estimates indicate that the roughly one billion square kilometers of world-wide leaf surfaces host more than 10e26 bacteria, which are the most abundant colonizers of this habitat. The overall microbiota in this ecosystem is thus sufficiently large to have an impact on the global carbon and nitrogen cycles. Additionally, the phyllosphere inhabitants influence their hosts at the level of the individual plants. To a large extent, interest in phyllosphere microbiology has been driven by investigations on plant pathogens. Their spread, colonization, survival, and pathogenicity mechanisms have been subject of numerous studies.    Much less understood are non-pathogenic microorganisms that inhabit the phyllosphere. The composition of the phyllosphere microbiota has been analyzed in only a few studies by cultivation-independent methods. However, such methods are essential in light of the yet uncultivated majority of bacteria existing in nature. Not only their identity, but in particular the physiological properties of phyllosphere bacteria, their adaptations to the habitat, and their potential role, e.g. with respect to modulating population sizes of pathogens, remain largely unknown.    Current knowledge on the traits important in the phyllosphere is derived from relatively few studies on gene expression, and stems mostly from model bacteria cultivated on host plants under controlled conditions. However, under natural conditions, plants and their residing microorganisms are exposed to a host of diverse, highly variable environmental factors including UV light, temperature, and water availability; moreover, individual microbes are subjected to competition with other microorganisms over resources such as nutrients and space. Towards a deeper understanding of phyllosphere microbiology, and in particular to learn more about the commensal majority of plant leaf colonizing bacteria, which may be of relevance for plant health and development, integrated approaches are needed.    Metagenomic and metaproteomic approaches (community proteogenomics) were combined in our study to analyze bacterial phyllosphere communities in situ (the phyllosphere is defined here as the environment comprising both the surface and the apoplast of leaves). This strategy provided insight into the physiology of bacteria and revealed common adaptation mechanisms among the phyllosphere populations.    In this study, genomic DNA was isolated from the microbial phyllosphere community of leaves from agriculturally grown soybean (Glycine max).    <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?holding=&db=Nucleotide&cmd=search&term=FN421717:FN421842[accn]">FN421717-FN421842 </a> are ribosomal RNA sequences associated with this project.

Community composition and ultrastructure of a continuous bioreactor enrichment culture, in which anaerobic methane oxidation (AOM) was coupled to nitrate reduction. The biomass consisted of aggregates that were dominated by nitrate-dependent anaerobic methane-oxidizing Methanoperedens-like archaea (40%) and nitrite-dependent anaerobic methane-oxidizing Methylomirabilis-like bacteria (50%).  The Methanoperedens sp. aggregates consisted of slightly irregular coccoid cells (~1.5 Âµm diameter) which produced extruding tubular structures and putative cell-to-cell contacts. Methylomirabilis sp. bacteria exhibited the polygonal cell shape typical of this genus. In AOM archaea and bacteria cytochrome c proteins were localized in the cytoplasm and periplasm respectively by cytochrome staining. For the first time the cell structure of anaerobic methane-oxidizing Methanoperedens sp. was revealed. Our results indicate that AOM bacteria and archaea might work closely together in the process of anaerobic methane oxidation.	ERR2026003,ERR2026004

DRP000621	Tick microbiomes revealed by Batch Learning Self-Organizing Maps (BLSOMs)	Tick can transmit a variety of viral, bacterial and protozoal pathogens, which are often zoonotic. The increasing number of novel tick-borne pathogens has been reported during recent decades. The aim of this study was to reveal a diversity of tick microbiomes which may contain as-yet unidentified pathogens using a metagenomic approach. Seven tick species (both field-collected and laboratory-reared) were used in the present study. Purified bacteria-enriched fraction prepared from tick homogenate was subjected to DNA extraction and pyrosequencing after whole genome amplification. Resulting sequence reads were phylotyped using a Batch Learning Self-Organizing Map (BLSOM) program, which allowed phylogenetic estimation based on the similarity of oligonucleotide frequencies, and functionally annotated by BLASTX similarity searches. We showed that ticks harboured a variety of bacteria including those previously associated with human and animal diseases such as genera Anaplasma, Bartonella, Borrelia, Ehrlichia, Francisella, and Rickettsia. Gene sequences associated with bacterial pathogenesis were identified and were suspected to be introduced through horizontal gene transfer. In conclusion, our efforts to construct a database of tick microbes may lead to the empowerment to predict emerging tick-borne diseases. A comprehensive understanding of the tick microbiomes will also be useful to understand tick biology including vector competency and interactions with pathogens.

ERP021080	Potential and active functions in the gut microbiota of a healthy human cohort	Gut microbiome research is rapidly moving towards the functional characterization of the microbiota by means of shotgun meta-omics. Here, we selected a cohort of healthy subjects from an indigenous and monitored Sardinian population to analyze their gut microbiota using both shotgun metagenomics and shotgun metaproteomics. We found a considerable divergence between genetic potential and functional activity of the human healthy gut microbiota, in spite of a quite comparable taxonomic structure revealed by the two approaches. Investigation of inter-individual variability of taxonomic features revealed Bacteroides and Akkermansia as remarkably conserved and variable in abundance within the population, respectively. Firmicutes-driven butyrogenesis (mainly due to Faecalibacterium spp.) was shown to be the functional activity with the higher expression rate and the lower inter-individual variability in the study cohort, highlighting the key importance of the biosynthesis of this microbial by-product for the gut homeostasis. The taxon-specific contribution to functional activities and metabolic tasks was also examined, giving insights into the peculiar role of several gut microbiota members in carbohydrate metabolism (including polysaccharide degradation, glycan transport, glycolysis and short-chain fatty acid production). In conclusion, our results provide useful indications regarding the main functions actively exerted by the gut microbiota members of a healthy human cohort, and support metaproteomics as a valuable approach to investigate the functional role of the gut microbiota in health and disease.

ERP010013	Core genomes of cosmopolitan surface ocean plankton	The sunlight surface layer of the ocean is the largest             contiguous biome on the planet.  The photoautotrophic microbial communities             in the ocean fix roughly equal amounts of CO2 through photosynthesis as all             terrestrial biomes, despite a widespread paucity of multiple nutrients.             The accompanying bacterioplankton communities are important in recycling             nutrients for autotrophs, providing or requiring vitamin cofactors, thereby             influencing the biogeochemical cycles of important green house gasses             N2O, CO2, dimethyl sulfide, and methane. The bacterioplankon communities             contain a high level of diversity , particularly of uncultivated organisms             with unknown genome contents. Single cell genomics and metagenomic assemblies             have characterized the genomes of a few uncultivated organisms , yet a             substantial portion of the community remains uncharacterized.  Here we report             the collection, assembly, and analysis of 225 metagenomes collected from the             euphotic zone of every ocean at temperatures from 0Â°C to 30Â°C.  A global assembly             resulted in 3 Gbp of contiguous DNA assemblies, or approximately 100 genomes             , representing over 80% of all metagenomic reads.  A large majority of the             assemblies are cosmopolitan, with over 50% being found in 50% of the metagenomic             sites, indicating a widespread genomic commonality between geographicall             y separated communities. The emergent genome biogeography illuminates a             temperature-driven distribution of genomes at multiple taxonomic levels from             strain to phyla, while protein family level analyses at a global and genus level             point to nutrient availability dictating finer scale variation.  The assemblies             provide a genomic characterization of the so-called microbial dark matter in this             environment at an unprecedented scale and point to lineage specific metabolic             specialization both in core metabolism and nutrient acquisition, a potential niche             diversification that leads to metasymbiosis within a complex community.

SRP103304	Coral hybridization or phenotypic variation? Genomic data reveal gene flow between Porites lobata and P. compressa	Major gaps remain in our understanding of the ecology, evolution, biodiversity, biogeography, extinction risk, and adaptive potential of reef building corals. One of the central challenges remains that there are few informative genetic markers for studying boundaries between species, and variation within species. Reduced representation sequencing approaches, such as RADseq (Restriction site Associated DNA sequencing) have great potential for resolving such relationships. However, it is necessary to identify loci in order to make inferences for endosymbiotic organisms such as corals. Here, we examined twenty-one coral holobiont ezRAD libraries from Hawai?i, focusing on P. lobata and P. compressa, two species with contrasting morphology and habitat preference that previous studies have not resolved.We used a combination of de novo assembly and reference mapping approaches to identify and compare loci: we used reference mapping to extract and compare nearly complete mitochondrial genomes, ribosomal arrays, and histone genes. We used de novo clustering and phylogenomic methods to compare the complete holobiont data set with coral and symbiont subsets that map to transcriptomic data. In addition, we used reference assemblies to examine genetic structure from SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms). All approaches resolved outgroup taxa but failed to resolve P. lobata and P. compressa as distinct, with mito-nuclear discordance and shared mitochondrial haplotypes within the species complex. The holobiont and â€˜coral transcriptomicâ€™ datasets were highly concordant, revealing stronger genetic structure between sites than between coral morphospecies. These results suggest that either branching morphology is a polymorphic trait, or that these species frequently hybridize. This study provides examples of several approaches to acquire, identify, and compare loci across metagenomic samples such as the coral holobiont while providing insights into the nature of coral variability.

ERP021973	Quantification of mock microbial communities with metagenomes, 16S rRNA gene amplicons and metaproteomics	In this study we compared methods for quantifying taxonomic composition of microbial communities. The compared methods included metagenomics, 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and metaproteomics. This ENA study contains the metagenomic and the 16S rRNA amplicon data. The metaproteomic data is available from ProteomeXchange via the PRIDE repository(PXD006118). For the comparison of the methods we analyzed three types of mock communities with all three methods. The communities contain between 28 to 32 species and strains of bacteria, archaea, eukaryotes and bacteriophage. For each community type 4 biological replicate communities were generated. All four replicates were analyzed by 16S rRNA sequencing. Three replicates of each community type were analyzed with metagenomics. The "C" type communities have same cell/phage particle number for all community members (C1 to C4). The "P" type communities have the same protein content for all community members (P1 to P4). The "U" (uneven) type communities cover a large range of protein amounts and cell numbers (U1 to U4). The 16S rRNA libraries were sequenced twice in independent runs. The prefixes "rep1_" and "rep2_" indicate the two individual runs. The 16S rRNA read files without prefix are rep1 and rep2 merged.

ERP005118	Diverse molecular signatures for ribosomally â€˜activeâ€™ Perkinsea in marine sediments	Background: Perkinsea are a parasitic lineage within the eukaryotic superphylum Alveolata. Recent studies making use of small sub-unit ribosomal RNA gene (SSU rDNA) methodologies have detected a significant diversity and abundance of Perkinsea-like phylotypes mainly in freshwater environments. Only a few Perkinsea sequences have been retrieved from marine waters while, in contrast, the only two groups of Perkinsea cultured and morphologically described are parasites of marine molluscs or other marine protists. These two marine groups form separate and distantly related clusters, composed of closely related lineages on SSU rDNA trees. Here, we test the hypothesis that Perkinsea are a hitherto under-sampled group in marine environments. Using 454 diversity â€˜tagâ€™ sequencing we investigate the genetic diversity and distribution of these protists in marine sediments and water column samples taken from the Deep Clorophyll Maximum (DCM) and sub-surface using both DNA and RNA as template and sampling four European offshore marine sites.  Results: We detected the presence of 265 sequences branching with known Perkinsea, the majority of them recovered from marine sediments. Phylogenetic analyses classify a large proportion of these sequences into 38 cluster groups (including 30 novel marine cluster groups), which share less than 97% sequence similarity as to suggest this diversity encompasses a range of biologically and ecologically distinct organisms. Moreover 27% of these sequences were derived from RNA derived cDNA libraries. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that Perkinsea lineage is considerably more diverse than previously detected in marine environments. This wide diversity of Perkinsea-like protists is largely retrieved in marine sediment with a significant proportion detected in RNA derived libraries as to suggest this diversity represents ribosomally â€˜activeâ€™ and intact cells present in these sediment environments. Given the phylogenetic range of hosts infected by known Perkinsea parasites, these data suggest that Perkinsea either play a significant but hitherto unrecognized role in marine sediment communities and/or members of this group are occupying the marine sediment possibly as â€˜seed bankâ€™.

Hypertension is one of the most prevalent cardiovascular diseases worldwide. Recent findings have identified a link between gut microbiota and blood pressure, yet the contributions of gut microbes and bacterial metabolites towards hypertension remain largely uncharacterized. We carried out metagenomic and metabonomics analyses, in combination with faecal microbiota transplantation, and elucidate that dysbiosis of gut microbiome triggers the pathogenesis of hypertension through altering the metabolic effects. Notably, we demonstrate similar discrepancy of microbial compositional and functional features in pre-hypertension and hypertension when compared with the controls, highlighting varied intestinal microbiota in prehypertensive populations. The impairment of host metabolism in pre-hypertension and hypertension was identified to be closely linked with dysbiotic gut microbiome. The hypertensive phenotype was transferrable from hypertension patients to germ-free mice by faecal transplant. Overall, our results explicate a novel role for aberrant gut microbiota as key contributor to the pathogenesis of hypertension, and emphasize the significance of early intervention for pre-hypertension.

ERP006808	Reagent and laboratory contamination can critically impact sequence based microbiome analyses	Background: The study of microbial communities has been revolutionised in recent years by the widespread adoption of culture independent analytical techniques such as 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metagenomics. One potential confounder of these sequence-based approaches is the presence of contamination in DNA extraction kits and other laboratory reagents. Results: In this study we demonstrate that contaminating DNA is ubiquitous in commonly used DNA extraction kits, varies greatly in composition between different kits and kit batches, and that this contamination critically impacts results obtained from samples containing a low microbial biomass. Conclusions: Contamination impacts both PCR-based 16S rRNA gene surveys and shotgun metagenomics. These results suggest that caution should be advised when applying sequence-based techniques to the study of microbiota present in low biomass environments. We provide an extensive list of potential contaminating genera, and guidelines on how to mitigate the effects of contamination. Concurrent sequencing of negative control samples is strongly advised.

SRP007091	Patterns of nucleotide misincorporations during enzymatic amplification and direct large-scale sequencing of ancient DNA.	Metagenomic sequence reads were derived from DNA extracted from a 43,000 old mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius) bone from Bol''shaya Kolopatkaya River in Russia.  Preliminary analysis found that 3% of these sequences align closest to elephant, indicating they are from the extinct mammmoth.  The rest of the sequences appear to be from prokaryotes that colonized the fossil.  DNA extracted from a 43,000 old mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius) bone from Bol''shaya Kolopatkaya River in Russia. Whereas evolutionary inferences derived from present-day DNA sequences are by necessity indirect, ancient DNA sequences provide a direct view of past genetic variants. However, base lesions that accumulate in DNA over time may cause nucleotide misincorporations when ancient DNA sequences are replicated. By repeated amplifications of mitochondrial DNA sequences from a large number of ancient wolf remains, we show that C/G-to-T/A transitions are the predominant type of such misincorporations. Using a massively parallel sequencing method that allows large numbers of single DNA strands to be sequenced, we show that modifications of C, as well as to a lesser extent of G, residues cause such misincorporations. Experiments where oligonucleotides containing modified bases are used as templates in amplification reactions suggest that both of these types of misincorporations can be caused by deamination of the template bases. New DNA sequencing methods in conjunction with knowledge of misincorporation processes have now, in principle, opened the way for the determination of complete genomes from organisms that became extinct during and after the last glaciation.

ERP010565	Characterization of biofoulants illustrates different membrane fouling mechanisms for aerobic and anaerobic membrane bioreactors	In this study, membrane performance and foulants characteristics were compared for both Aerobic Membrane Bioreactor (AeMBR) and Anaerobic Membrane Bioreactor (AnMBR). Both employed a similar reactor configuration and were operated at the same condition. Similar COD removal efficiencies were seen in both systems while fouling rates were higher in the AeMBR. The size distribution of Soluble Microbial Products (SMP) and Extracellular Polymeric Substances (EPS) in the AnMBR showed that a majority of the EPS fragments could be derived from the retained SMP fractions, suggesting that the major contributor to AnMBR membrane fouling was the physical retention of SMP components. Although more EPS was present on the AeMBR membranes than the AnMBR, SMP was not a main contributor to membrane fouling as all foulant fractions in AeMBR-SMP were totally permeated through the membrane. However, a larger amount of ATP was present in the AeMBR as compared to the AnMBR suggesting that the derivation of AeMBR-EPS may be from microbial activity of certain bacterial populations attached on the membrane, such as Comamonas and unclassified Chitinophagaceae. This study underlines the different fouling mechanisms associated with AeMBR and AnMBR and facilitates developing different strategies for fouling control in AeMBR and AnMBR.	ERR904490

ERP022517	Enrichment of anaerobic nitrate-dependent methanotrophic Candidatus Methanoperedens nitroreducens archaea from an Italian paddy field soil	Paddy fields are a significant source of methane and contribute up to 20% of total methane emissions from wetland ecosystems. These inundated, anoxic soils featuring abundant nitrogen compounds and methane are an ideal niche for nitrate-dependent anaerobic methanotrophs. After 2 years of enrichment with a continuous supply of methane and nitrate as the sole electron donor and acceptor, a stable enrichment dominated by 'Candidatus Methanoperedens nitroreducens' archaea and 'Candidatus Methylomirabilis oxyfera' NC10 phylum bacteria was achieved. The results of qPCR quantification of 16S rRNA gene copies, analysis of metagenomic 16S rRNA reads,and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) correlated well and showed that, after two years, 'Candidatus Methanoperedens nitroreducens' had the highest (2.2Â±0.4*108) 16S rRNA copies per mL and constituted approximately 22% of the total microbial community.Metagenomic sequencing by Ion Torrent Technology was carried out after one and two years of enrichment. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the 16S rRNA genes of the dominant microorganisms clustered with previously described 'Candidatus Methanoperedens nitroreducens ANME2D' (96% identity) and 'Candidatus Methylomirabilis oxyfera' (99% identity) strains. The pooled metagenomic sequences resulted in a high-quality draft genome assembly of 'Candidatus Methanoperedens nitroreducens Vercelli' that contained all key functional genes for the reverse methanogenesis pathway and nitrate reduction. The diagnostic mcrA gene was 96% similar to 'Candidatus Methanoperedens nitroreducens ANME2D' (WP_048089615.1) at the protein level.The 'Candidatus Methylomirabilis oxyfera' draft genome contained the marker genes pmoCAB, mdh, and nirS and putative NO dismutase genes. Whole-reactor anaerobic activity measurements with methane and nitrate revealed an average methane oxidation rate of 0.012 mmol h-1 L-1, with cell-specific methane oxidation rates up to 0.57 fmol cell-1 day-1 for 'Candidatus Methanoperedens nitroreducens'. In summary, this study describes the first enrichment and draft genome of methanotrophic archaea from paddy field soil, where these organisms can contribute significantly to the mitigation of methane emissions.

ERP016486	Impact of the Sample Type and DNA Isolation Procedure on Genomic Inference of Microbiome Composition	Explorations of complex microbiomes using genomics greatly enhance our understanding about their diversity, biogeography, and predicted function. The isolation of DNA from microbiome specimens is a key prerequisite for such examinations, but challenges remain in obtaining sufficient DNA quantities required for certain sequencing approaches, achieving accurate genomic inference of microbiome composition, and facilitating comparability of findings across specimen types and sequencing projects. These aspects are particularly relevant for the genomics-based global surveillance of infectious agents and antimicrobial resistance from different reservoirs. Here, we compare a total of eight DNA extraction procedures for three specimen types (human feces, pig feces, hospital sewage), assess DNA extraction using spike-in controls and different types of beads for bead-beating facilitating cell lysis. We evaluate DNA concentration, purity, and stability, and microbial community composition using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and for selected samples using shotgun metagenomic sequencing. Our results suggest that inferred community composition was dependent on inherent specimen properties as well as DNA extraction method. We further show that bead-beating or enzymatic treatment can increase the extraction of DNA from Gram-positive bacteria. Final DNA quantities could be increased by isolating DNA from a larger volume of cell lysate compared to standard protocols. Based on this insight, we have designed an improved DNA isolation procedure that can be used for the three examined specimen types and potentially also for other biological specimens.

ERP002583	Metagenomic De Novo Assembly of an Aquatic Representative of the Verrucomicrobial Class Spartobacteria	The verrucomicrobial subdivision 2, class Spartobacteria, is one of the most abundant bacterial lineages in soil and has recently also been found ubiquitous in aquatic environments. A 16S rRNA gene study from samples spanning the entire salinity range of the Baltic Sea indicated that, in the pelagic brackish water, a phylotype of the Spartobacteria is one of the dominating bacteria during summer. Phylogenetic analyses of related 16S rRNA genes indicate that a purely aquatic lineage within the Spartobacteria exists. Since no aquatic representative from the Spartobacteria has been cultured or sequenced, the metabolic capacity and ecological role of this lineage are yet unknown. In this study, we reconstructed the genome and metabolic potential of the abundant Baltic Sea Spartobacteria phylotype by metagenomics. Binning of genome fragments by nucleotide composition and a self-organizing map recovered the near complete genome of the organism, the gene content of which suggests an aerobic heterotrophic metabolism. Notably, we found 23 glycoside hydrolases that likely allow the use of a variety of carbohydrates like cellulose, mannan, xylan, chitin, and starch as carbon sources. In addition, a complete pathway for sulfate utilization was found, indicating catabolic processing of sulfated polysaccharides, commonly found in aquatic phytoplankton. The high frequency of glycoside hydrolase genes implies an important role of this organism in the aquatic carbon cycle. Spatiotemporal data of the phylotypeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s distribution within the Baltic Sea indicate a connection to Cyanobacteria that may hence be the main source of the polysaccharide substrates.	ERR274572

ERP009429	Optimizing protocols for extraction of bacteriophages prior to metagenomic analyses of phage communities in the human gut	Background: The human gut is densely populated with archaea, eukaryotes, bacteria and their viruses, such as bacteriophages, that play also a prominent role. Recent advances in high-throughput sequencing (HTS) as well as bioinformatics have opened new opportunities for characterizing the viral communities harbored in our gut. However, limited attention has communities prior to HTS and their impact on the metagenomic dataset.  Results: We describe two optimized methods for extraction of phages from fecal samples based on tangential-flow filtration (TFF) and polyethylene glycol precipitation (PEG) approaches using an adapted method from a published protocol as control (LIT). To quantify phage recovery, samples were spiked with c2, ?29 and T4 phages (representatives of the Siphoviridae, Podoviridae and Myoviridae families, respectively) and their concentration (determined as plaque forming units, PFU) followed at every step during the extraction procedure. Compared with LIT, TFF and PEG had higher recovery rates of all spiked phages, yielding up to 16 times more phage particles (PPs) and up to 68 times more phage DNA per volume. By improving phage extraction, the metagenomic dataset showed a 10% increase in relative distribution of Caudovirales and unclassified phages infecting gut-associated bacteria  (<92% for TFF and PEG; while 82.4% for LIT). TFF and PEG methods obtained a lower relative abundance of the Myoviridae family (>16%) as compared to the reference protocol (27%). This latter decline, however, was not considered as Myophages loss, but rather an increase in the abundance of Siphophages (TFF and PEG: <36.8%, LIT: 28.4%), whose greater extraction, was achieved through to the enhanced filtration conditions of our procedures (e.g. reduction of filter clogging). Conclusion: Two procedures for extraction of bacteriophages from fecal samples, relaying on two well known laboratory techniques such as TFF and PEG, were optimized and standardized using a set of spiked bacteriophages as process control. These optimized procedures proved to be highly efficient and robust tools for extraction and purification of PPs that are suitable for quantification, high-throughput sequencing and further phageome studies.

SRP044188	Fungi of the healthy and immunocompromised human airway:  enhanced stringency analysis for taxon identification reveals covariation with bacterial populations	Background: Fungi are important pathogens but challenging to enumerate using next-generation sequencing data because of low absolute abundance in many samples and high levels of fungal DNA from contaminating sources. Results: Here we analyzed fungal lineages present in the human airway using an improved method for contamination filtering.  We compared fungal communities and bacterial communities from healthy subjects, HIV+ subjects, and lung transplant recipients, providing a gradient of increasing lung impairment for comparison.  We used deep sequencing to characterize ribosomal rRNA gene segments from fungi (ITS amplicon) and bacteria (16S amplicon) in DNA extracted from bronchiolar lavage samples (n=89) and oropharyngeal wash (n=36).  We introduce the use of DNA quantification data, which is routinely acquired during DNA library preparation, to annotate sequencing data and improve the identification and filtering of the contamination background. Conclusions: Using the abundance-weighted method, we quantified fungi authentically present in samples, showing increased representation of medically relevant organisms, including Candida, Cryptococcus, and Aspergillus, in the subjects with increasingly severe pulmonary and immunologic deficits.  We analyzed covariation of fungal and bacterial taxa, and found that oropharyngeal communities rich in Candida were also enriched in mitis group Streptococci, a community pattern associated with pathogenic polymicrobial biofilms. Thus, using this approach, it is possible to identify and characterize fungal communities in the human respiratory tract more accurately and explore their linkage to bacterial communities and to disease.

SRP069344	marine metagenome Genome sequencing and assembly	Marine microorganisms derive energy and carbon from the degradation of hydrocarbons in oil, which aids in the bioremediation process during anthropogenic oil spills, such as during the Deepwater Horizon (DWH) spill. Our knowledge of the underlying degradation pathways is mostly limited to a few cultured bacteria. Our research goal is to identify active hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria and resolve the metabolic potential of these uncultured bacteria. Therefore, we performed metagenomic sequencing on SIP-DNA samples from sea surface and plume samples from the Gulf of Mexico collected during the DWH oil spill in 2010. Plume and sea surface samples were separately exposed with heavy labeled n-hexadecane (HEX) as well as naphthalene (NAP) and phenanthrene (PHE) in stable isotope probing (SIP) experiments.

ERP012786	Metagenomic data from 12 aquaria for determination of the minimal selective concentration of tetracycline in complex communities	Selection pressure of antibiotics released into the environment could enrich for antibiotic resistance genes and antibiotic resistant bacteria, thus, increasing the risk for their transmission to humans and animals. Tetracyclines comprise an antibiotic class of importance to both human and animal health, and residues of tetracycline are commonly detected in aquatic environments. To assess if environmental pollution of tetracycline promotes development of resistance, we determined minimal selective concentrations (MSCs) in biofilms of complex aquatic bacterial communities using both phenotypic and genotypic assays.  Taxonomic analyses of the biofilm communities suggested that composition was altered with increasing tetracycline concentrations. Metagenomic analysis revealed a concurrent increase of several tet genes and a range of other genes providing resistance to other classes of antibiotics, indicating co-selection potential. The methodology used here to assess MSCs could be applied in risk assessment of other antibiotics as well.

ERP019513	A randomized trial of bread consumption: Personal glycemic responses and effects on clinical parameters and gut microbiome	Background: Bread is consumed by billions of people daily but evidence regarding the effect of different types of bread on clinical parameters is contradicting. In addition, the effect of bread consumption on the microbiome, an important effector of metabolic health, has not been extensively studied. Methods and Findings: We recruited 20 healthy human subjects and performed a 2x2 randomized crossover trial with baseline measurements of two one-week-long dietary interventions. In both interventions subjects consumed a single type of bread and refrained from consuming other wheat products. Consumed bread included industrial white bread made from refined wheat in one intervention, and sourdough leavened bread made with traditional methods from whole-grain wheat in the other. We found no significant differences in the effects of the different types of breads on multiple clinical parameters. In contrast, a one-week long dietary intervention of bread consumption, regardless of its type, resulted in numerous statistically significant changes, including an increase in LDH levels and a reduction of cholesterol, liver enzymes, creatinine, CRP, magnesium, and iron levels. Notably, despite its marked clinical phenotypic effect, bread consumption did not significantly alter the gut microbiome species composition, but it did induce several statistically significant and consistent changes in the abundance of genes from distinct microbial metabolic pathways. Metabolic pathways that increased following short-term bread consumption have elevated abundance in long-term bread consumers, suggesting that the effect of a short-term dietary change on the microbiome may persist in individuals that maintain the dietary change. Finally, using a statistically rigorous framework we found that our study subjects exhibited high interpersonal variability in their postprandial glycemic responses to the different bread types. Conclusions: We detected no difference between wholegrain sourdough and industrial white breads used in this study in their effects on multiple clinical parameters. Conversely, we showed that even a week long consumption of bread, irrespective of its type, induces changes to multiple clinical variables and risk factors. Our study shows that the microbiome species composition is resilient even to significant dietary interventions, but suggests that changes in microbial metabolic pathways induced by short-term interventions are retained in long-term bread consumers. The personalized postprandial glycemic responses to different bread types that we detected across subjects may partly explain the lack of differential effects between bread types and the contradicting evidence regarding the effects of different bread types in previous studies.

Five samples were taken from the pockmarked sediments overlaying the Troll petroleum (oil and gas) reservoir in the northern North Sea. sediment samples from four pockmark samples and one sample from the Troll plain were sequenced.  Two samples were taken from the outer part of the Oslofjord, Norway. Presence of thermogenic hydrocarbons is this area is unlikely.  The aim of the study was to characterize the taxonomic distribution and metabolic potential of the prokaryote communities inhabiting the Troll sediments, both in general and related to possible thermogenic hydrocarbon degradation. Further, we have investigated whether there was an increased potential for methane oxidation or other microbial processes, supporting seepage in pockmark sediments, or if analyses of the microbial communities would agree with the geological analyses indicating no active hydrocarbon seepage from the pockmarks at the present time. The two Oslofjord sediments were used as references regarding thermogenic hydrocarbon influence.

SRP005282	Hydrogen-isotopic variability in fatty acids from Yellowstone National Park hot spring microbial communities	We report the abundances and hydrogen-isotopic compositions (D/H ratios) of fatty acids extracted from hot-spring microbial mats in Yellowstone National Park. The terrestrial hydrothermal environment provides a useful system for studying D/H fractionations because the numerous microbial communities in and around the springs are distinct and separable, and simpler than many other aquatic environments. D/H fractionations between lipids and water ranged from -478Ã¢?Â° to +41Ã¢?Â° and showed systematic variations between different types of microbial communities. Lipids produced by chemoautotrophic hyperthermophilic bacteria, such as icosenoic acid (20:1), generally exhibited the largest and most variable fractionations from water (-478Ã¢?Â° to -165Ã¢?Â°). This was in contrast to lipids characteristic of heterotrophs, such as branched, odd chain-length fatty acids, which had the smallest fractionations (-163Ã¢?Â° to +41Ã¢?Â°). Mats dominated by photoautotrophs exhibited intermediate fractionations similar in magnitude to those expressed by higher plants. These data support the hypothesis that variations in lipid D/H are strongly influenced by central metabolic pathways. Shifts in the isotopic compositions of individual fatty acids across known ecological boundaries show that the isotopic signature of specific metabolisms can be deciphered in modern environmental samples, and potentially recorded in ancient ones. Considering all sampled springs, the total range in D/H ratios is similar to that observed in marine sediments, suggesting that the trends observed here are not exclusive to the hydrothermal environment.

SRP049645	Human skin bacterial metagenome and Virome Metagenome	Viruses can impact microbiome structure and function through predation and genetic exchange, but little is known of cutaneous viral communities and their interactions with their hosts. To query virus-host interactions of the skin, we performed parallel metagenomic sequencing and an integrated analysis of DNA isolated from virus-like particles (VLPs) and total microbial communities. To assess spatial, interpersonal, and temporal variance, samples were collected from eight anatomical skin sites of 16 healthy individuals over two months. Skin viral communities were dominated by tailed bacteriophages--viruses replicating on human cells were comparatively rare. Similar to the skin whole metagenome, viral community composition and diversity was strongly associated with the microenvironment of the site sampled, and temporal variation within an individual was small compared to differences between individuals. Virome communities were enriched for genes indicative of a temperate phage replication style, indicating that many infections would be non-lethal to the host and provide an opportunity for gene transfer. CRISPR spacers identified in the bacterial DNA sequences provided a record of phage predation. Among these, some spacers targeted phage found at different body sites, suggesting that CRISPR spacer acquisition may provide a mechanism to explain spatial partitioning of skin phage communities. Our findings provide new insight into the skin virome, its interactions with the whole metagenome, and establish a foundation for understanding these dynamics in skin health and disease.

SRP039009	Subway environment and outdoor air Targeted Locus (Loci)	Subway and mass transit has become one of the most crucial mode of transport for commuters in urbanized areas. However, the bacterial community composition of this environment has previously been mostly based on culture-based studies; culture-independent high-throughput sequencing studies investigating air in subways are limited. This project used Illumina MiSeq technology to unravel bacterial diversity and microbial community compositions of subway network in Hong Kong as well as selected outdoor locations in the city. The results will provide valuable information in understanding the routine microbial exposure of a typical commuter.	SRR1300040

SRP096283	Human gut metagenome and metatranscriptome raw sequence reads.	We conducted metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequencing of the human gut microbiome among 308 participants enrolled in a subcohort of men nested within the Health Professionals Follow-up Study. Using a previously validated self-sampling stool collection method (PMID24843156), participants provided up to four stool samples â€“ one set of samples collected approximately 48 hours apart followed by a second set approximately 6 months later. DNA extracted from 929 stool samples and RNA extracted from 378 stool samples was reverse-transcribed to cDNA and sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq platform. Raw data were filtered to remove low quality and human reads.

SRP083086	Manleluag Spring National Park Metagenome	Manleluag Spring National Park (the Philippines) hosts several continental serpentinizing fluid springs in a tropical, densely vegetated environment. The spring fluids originate in the Acoje block of the Zambales ophiolite range, and are ultra-basic (pH ~10.9) and oligotrophic. Uranium-thorium radiometric dating indicates that the Zambales ophiolite complex is approximately 40 Myr old, placing formation of the oceanic crust in a nascent island arc during Eocene seafloor spreading (Abrajano et al., 1988; Hawkins and Evans, 1983). Fluid and sediment samples were collected for metagenomic analysis to characterize the deep subsurface microbial community originating in these springs. Samples were collected in two ways: a) by pumping approximately 20 liters of spring fluid through 0.22 Âµm MilliporeÂ® Sterivexâ„¢ filter units (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) via peristaltic pump, and b) by collection of sediment from spring pools in Whirl-PakÂ® sampling bags (Nasco, Fort Atkinson, WI, USA). Previously conducted 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing analysis indicated that the springs hosted microbial consortia primarily consisting of Bacteroidetes, Deinococcus-Thermi, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Euryarchaeota (Woycheese et al., 2015). Geochemical parameters observed in Manleluag springs indicated that methanogenesis/methanotrophy, hydrogen oxidation, iron cycling, sulfur cycling, and ammonia oxidation were all feasible based on bioenergetic yield calculations (Cardace et al., 2015). The results of this analysis provide further insight into the taxonomic diversity and metabolic capacity of microbial communities in oligotrophic, deeply-sourced tropical serpentinizing fluid springs.References:Abrajano, T.A., et al., (1988).

SRP056932	Metagenomic analysis of thiocyanate and cyanide biodegrading microbial consortia Metagenome	Gold mining and other industrial activities make extensive use of cyanide (CN-) and produce large volumes of thiocyanate- (SCN-) contaminated wastewater that must be treated before reuse in mining processes. Furthermore, contaminated wastewater stored in tailings dams may pose an environmental threat through the potential for leakage into local groundwater. Microbial communities are often used for biodegradation and environmental remediation, however, little is known about the membership and metabolic potential of SCN-degrading consortia. Application and improvement of the remediation strategy will benefit from an understanding of organisms that can contribute to the breakdown of SCN- into sulfur, carbon and nitrogen compounds. To this end, we performed metagenomic analysis of samples from two laboratory-scale bioreactors used to study SCN- and CN- degradation by established microbial consortia. Community analysis revealed the dominance of Thiobacillus spp. whose genomes harbor a previously unreported operon for SCN- degradation. Metabolic predictions suggest that a large portion of each bioreactor community is autotrophic, relying not on molasses in reactor feed, but using energy gained from oxidation of the sulfur compounds produced during SCN- degradation. Heterotrophs compose a smaller portion of the reactor bacterial community, and predation by phage and eukaryotes is predicted to affect community dynamics. Furthermore, genes for ammonium oxidation and denitrification were detected, possibly allowing removal of nitrogen as required for complete remediation of wastewater. These findings suggest possible optimization strategies for reactor design such as improved aerobic/anaerobic partitioning and elimination of organic carbon from reactor feed.

The purpose of this project is to investigate change in microbial community with depths in a terrestrial mud volcano. We would like to clarify which microbial group is responsible for biosynthetic methanogen production and how methane is removed by anaerobic and aerobic methanotrophic bacteria at different depths.

DRP003557	Microbial metagenome analysis of soybean root nodules	Recently, high-throughput sequencing technology is rapidly improving in quality, speed and cost. It is, therefore, becoming more widely used to study on whole bacterial communities. Rhizobial inoculation was often unsuccessful in legume fields, because soil native strains highly competed with the introduced inoculants. Conventional methods to monitor the behavior of inoculants are likely impractical and time-consuming in agricultural fields. Thus, We analyzed  metagenome of the bacterial community associated with root nodules of soybean (Glycine max [L.] Merr., var. Tachinagaha) in order to descriminate the inoculant population from soil native population of soybean bradyrhizobia in an agricultural soil by mapping metagenome reads to the representative soybean bradyrhizobial genomes.

SRP042293	Altering the intestinal microbiota during a critical developmental window	Disruption of the microbiota by low-dose antibiotic exposure can alter host metabolism and adiposity. We now show that low-dose penicillin (LDP) delivered from birth enhanced metabolic alterations, and that there were additive effects in combination with high fat diet. LDP that was limited to early life was sufficient for sustained effects on body composition. After the cessation of penicillin, the microbial communities recovered, yet metabolic phenotypes persisted, indicating that microbiota interactions in infancy may be critical determinants of long-term host effects. Early-life LDP was associated with alterations in ileal expression of genes involved in immunity. The growth promotion phenotype was transferrable to germ-free hosts by LDP-selected microbiota, not antibiotics per se. These studies characterize important variables in early-life microbe-host metabolic interaction, and identify several taxa consistently linked with metabolic alterations.	SRR1426736

ERP002499	Home Life: Factors structuring the bacterial diversity found within and between homes	Most of our time is spent indoors where we are exposed to a wide array of different microorganisms living on surfaces and in the air of our homes. Despite their ubiquity and abundance, we have a limited understanding of the microbial diversity found within homes and how the composition and diversity of microbial communities change across different locations within the home. Here we examined the diversity of bacterial communities found in nine distinct locations within each of forty homes in the Raleigh-Durham area of North Carolina, USA, using high-throughput sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. We found that each of the sampled locations harbored bacterial communities that were distinct from one another with surfaces that are regularly cleaned typically harboring lower levels of diversity than surfaces that are cleaned infrequently. These location-specific differences in bacterial communities could be directly related to usage patterns and differences in the likely sources of bacteria dispersed onto these locations. Finally, we examined whether the variability across homes in bacterial diversity could be attributed to outdoor environmental factors, indoor habitat structure, or the occupants of the home. We found that the presence of dogs had a significant effect on bacterial community composition in multiple locations within homes as the homes occupied by dogs harbored more diverse communities and higher relative abundances of dog-associated bacterial taxa. Furthermore, we found a significant correlation between the types of bacteria deposited on surfaces outside the home and those found inside the home, highlighting that microbes from outside the home can have a direct effect on the microbial communities living on surfaces within our homes. Together this work provides the first comprehensive analysis of the microbial communities found in the home and the factors that shape the structure of these communities both within and between homes.

SRP119417	Hi-C deconvolution of a human gut microbiome yields high-quality draft genomes and reveals plasmid-genome interactions.	The assembly of high-quality genomes from mixed microbial samples is a long-standing problem in genomics and metagenomics. Here, we describe the application of ProxiMetaTM, a Hi-C-based metagenomic deconvolution method, to deconvolve a human fecal sample. This method uses the intra-cellular proximity signal captured by Hi-C as a direct indicator of which sequences originated in the same cell, enabling culture-free de novo deconvolution of mixed genomes without any reliance on a priori information. We show that ProxiMeta provides incredibly high accuracy and sensitivity deconvolution, yielding 50 near-complete microbial genomes (many of which are novel) from a single fecal sample, and outperforms state-of-the-art contig binning approaches at high-quality genome reconstruction. ProxiMeta shows particularly good performance in constructing high-quality genomes for diverse but poorly-characterized members of the human gut, and offers additional information about microbial genome biology. We further use ProxiMeta to reconstruct genome plasmid content and gene sharing of plasmids â€“ tasks that traditional binning methods often fail to accomplish. Our findings suggest that ProxiMeta-based deconvolution can be useful to a variety of applications in genomics and metagenomics.	SRR6131122,SRR6131123,SRR6131124

ERP000829	Establishment and validation of a double index protocol	Due to the increasing throughput of current DNA sequencing instruments, sample multiplexing is necessary for making economical use of available sequencing capacities. A widely used multiplexing strategy for the Illumina Genome Analyzer utilizes sample-specific indexes, which are embedded in one of the library adapters. However, this and similar multiplex approaches come with a risk of sample misidentification. By introducing indexes into both library adapters (double indexing), we have developed a method that reveals the rate of sample misidentification within current multiplex sequencing experiments. With around 0.3% these rates are orders of magnitude higher than expected and may severely confound applications in cancer genomics and other fields requiring accurate detection of rare variants. We identified the occurrence of mixed clusters on the flow as the predominant source of error. The accuracy of sample identification is further impaired if indexed oligonucleotides are cross-contaminated or if indexed libraries are amplified in bulk. Double-indexing eliminates these problems and increases both the scope and accuracy of multiplex sequencing on the Illumina platform.	ERR042425,ERR042427

SRP016633	PAMPA Dataset: Argentinean agricultural pampean soils Metagenome	Soil microbial communities are among the most diverse and complex environments in the world. Our information about the identity and metabolic capabilities of terrestrial microbes is still scarce. Moreover, although microorganisms in soil are essential for nitrogen, carbon, phosphorous and sulfur cycling as well as plant growth and crop production, only a few microbial species involved in these processes have been described in detail. The future years will face the challenge of increasing agricultural yields conserving soil microbial communities and soil quality. To do so, a better comprehension of micro-ecosystem functioning and microbial description will be needed. As a first modest approach towards the understanding of soil microbial communities and how land use affects them, we have generated a metagenomic dataset obtained by high throughput sequencing of samples from Argentinean Pampas. Three different geographic regions, three different types of land uses and two soil types (bulk and rhizospheric) were analyzed using whole genome shotgun (WGS) and amplicon sequencing. A total of 19 Mi (7.7 Gb) WGS reads and over 1 Mi 16 rRNA pyrotags were generated. Our preliminary results suggest that soil microbial communities are different at both, taxonomic and metabolic level, on each type of tillage system and geographic region in bulk soils. Rhizospheric microbial communities resulted markedly different from those in bulk soils and less sensitive to the type of tillage system. This dataset is the first soil metagenomic study in Argentina and one of the few available in the world. This should be considered as a kick-start for future efforts towards a better comprehension of soil microbial communities in agricultural systems in the Argentinean region and a useful comparison dataset for other regions in the world.

ERP006677	Consumption of artificial sweeteners induces glucose intolerance by functionally altering the gut microbiota	Non-caloric artificial sweeteners (NAS) are among the most widely used food additives worldwide, regularly consumed by lean and obese individuals alike. NAS consumption is considered safe and beneficial due to their low caloric content, yet supporting scientific data remains sparse and controversial. Here, we demonstrate that consumption of commonly used NAS formulations drives the development of glucose intolerance, through induction of compositional and functional alterations to the intestinal microbiota. These NAS-mediated deleterious metabolic effects are abrogated by antibiotic treatment, and are fully transferrable to germ-free mice upon fecal transplantation of microbiota configurations from NAS-consuming mice, or of microbiota anaerobically incubated in the presence of NAS. We identify NAS-altered microbial metabolic pathways that are linked to host susceptibility to metabolic disease, and demonstrate similar NAS-induced dysbiosis and glucose intolerance in healthy human subjects. Collectively, our results link NAS consumption, dysbiosis, and metabolic abnormalities, thereby calling for reassessment of massive NAS usage.

SRP006906	Comparative metatranscriptomics identifies molecular bases for the physiological responses of phytoplankton to varying iron availability	In vast expanses of the oceans, growth of large phytoplankton such as diatoms is limited by iron availability.  Diatoms respond almost immediately to the delivery of iron and rapidly comprise the majority of phytoplankton biomass. The molecular bases underlying the subsistence of diatoms in iron-poor waters and the plankton community dynamics that follow iron-resupply remain largely unknown.  Here we use comparative metatranscriptomics to identify changes in gene expression associated with iron-stimulated growth of diatoms and other eukaryotic plankton groups. A microcosm iron-enrichment experiment using mixed-layer waters from the NE Pacific Ocean resulted in increased proportions of diatom transcripts with a subsequent reduction in proportions of transcripts from most other taxa within 98 hours after iron addition. Hundreds of diatom genes were differentially expressed in the iron-enriched community when compared to iron-limited community; transcripts of diatom genes required for synthesis of photosynthesis and chlorophyll components, nitrate assimilation and the urea cycle, and synthesis of hydrocarbon storage compounds were significantly over-represented. Transcripts of genes encoding rhodopsins in eukaryotic phytoplankton were significantly under-represented following iron enrichment, suggesting rhodopsins help cells cope with low-iron conditions. Oceanic diatoms appear to display a distinctive transcriptional response to iron enrichment that allow chemical reduction of available nitrogen and carbon sources along with a continued dependence on iron-free photosynthetic proteins rather than substituting for iron-containing functional equivalents present within their gene repertoire. This ability of diatoms to divert their newly acquired iron towards nitrate assimilation may underlie why diatoms consistently dominate iron enrichments in HNLC regions.

SRP066380	Functional Genes Discriminate Between Maize Phyllosphere Metagenomes in Drought and Well-Watered Conditions	Plants form a wide variety of intimate associations with a diversity of microorganism (bacteria, fungi and viruses) that include the phyllosphere or the aerial parts of plant especially the leaves. Drought represents one of the most important abiotic stresses as limited water availability reduces yield world-wide. Future projections under climate change suggest that water availability will decline, and water demand will increase which will place new demands on agriculture. Maintaining crop yield under drought stress requires an understanding and integration of a variety of component traits including an understanding of the plant microbiome .In this National Science Foundation supported project, the microbiome of the phyllosphere (specifically from leaf surfaces) from corn or maize, Zea mays L., one of the most widely grown and economically important annual crops, was investigated under conditions when plants were well-watered versus drought. The microbiome of leaf surface communities from maize under drought and well-watered conditions from three locations in the US (Halfway TX, Dumas Etter TX and Berkeley CA) was deeply sequenced using metagenomics approaches. Data was subsequently analyzed using a variety of annotation and statistical methods.

ERP010943	Active agricultural soil denitrifiers possess extensive nitrite reductase gene diversity	Denitrification in agricultural fields transforms nitrogen applied as fertilizer, reduces crop production, and emits N2O, which is a potent greenhouse gas. Existing primers and probes used for detecting denitrifiers are biased due to their development based primarily on sequence information from cultured denitrifiers; very little is known about the identities of active denitrifiers in agricultural soils. Using targeted metagenomics, we explored active and uncultivated denitrifiers from two agricultural sites in Ottawa, Ontario. The DNA stable-isotope probing (DNA-SIP) method recovered labelled nucleic acids from active soil denitrifiers by exposing intact replicate soil cores to nitrate and 13C6-glucose under anoxic conditions using flow-through reactors. Multivariate statistics of assembled 16S rRNA genes confirmed unique taxonomic representation in heavy fractions from flow-through reactors fed 13C6-glucose, which was consistent across sites and time points. Labelled taxa affiliated with the Betaproteobacteria (71%; Janthinobacterium, Acidovorax, Azoarcus, Dechloromonas), Alphaproteobacteria (8%; Rhizobium), Gammaproteobacteria (4%; Pseudomonas), and Actinobacteria (4%; Streptomycetaceae). High-throughput sequencing of metagenomic DNA from the original soil and DNA-SIP heavy fractions confirmed amplicon sequence data by demonstrating enrichment of denitrification genes affiliated with Janthinobacterium, Ralstonia, and Azoarcus in heavy fractions of flow-through reactors. The vast majority of heavy-DNA-associated nitrite-reductase reads annotated to the copper-containing form (nirK), rather than the heme-containing enzyme (nirS). Analysis of recovered nirK genes demonstrated low sequence identity across common primer-binding sites used for the detection and quantification of soil denitrifiers, indicating that these active denitrifiers would not have been detected in molecular surveys of these same soils and suggesting that no single primer set can be used for detecting the nirK genes of all known soil denitrifiers.

Bacteria-dominated biological soil crusts play a role in demobilizing dunes in many arid regions. Although biological soil crusts are not present on these dunes, a bacterial community is present within the dunes. To better understand the microbial populations within these dunes, we undertook 16S deep-sequencing of DNA extracts from sand samples from the crest, middle, and base of the windward faces of mobile barchan sand dunes near Doha, Qatar. Soil samples from beneath several dunes were also deep-sequenced. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing of two dunes was also conducted.	SRR2087248,SRR2087249

SRP004544	Metagenomes isolated from NE Brazil	Mangroves are important and productive ecosystems found in tropical and subtropical environments, providing habitats for a variety of species. These ecosystems have been suffering from impacts through the years and consequently the activity of soil microorganisms, which are directly related to valuable processes in these environments, is affected. Understanding the diversity and function of microbial communities and their response to environmental changes is essential for the maintenance of significant functions in these ecosystems. Currently few studies in Brazil are devoted to the understanding of microbial diversity in mangrove soils. Thus it becomes essential to study the microbial diversity in these environments and to search for genes encoding for enzymes of biotechnological interest. For this reason, the aim of this study was to assess the soil microbial diversity from four mangroves in Ceara state, northeast Brazil, and its response to possible impacts, and search genes of biotechnological interest using metagenomics strategies.  The four studied mangroves are located in the state of Ceara, northeastern Brazil. Two of them are located in the extreme east (Jaguaribe Mangrove) and west (the Mangrove Timonha) coast of the state separated by 530 km and the other two are located in a central region, near the city of Fortaleza, state capital (Coco and Pacoti mangroves). Jaguaribe (JAG) mangrove is located at the largest river of the state, in a sub-urbanized region, and impacted by agriculture run-off and extensive shrimp farming. In contrast, Timonha (TIM) is an undisturbed mangrove, located in an island inside the estuary, with limited access to humans. The CocÃ³ (COC) and Pacoti (PAC) mangroves, located in the metropolitan region of Fortaleza, suffer impacts due to water pollution, deforestation of native vegetation, especially vegetation of dunes and mangroves, extraction of sand, clay, stone and release of industrial effluents. The sampling locations TIM - S 02Âº56.587â€™ W 041Âº19.064â€™; JAG - S 04Â°26.749â€™ W 37Â°46.989â€™; PAC - S 03Âº49.226â€™ W 038Âº24.286â€™; COC - S 03Â°46.482â€™ W 38Â°26.552â€™. Sediment samples were collected in three sites inside the mangroves aiming to cover typical habitats in this ecosystems: near the river, Rhizophora mangle forest and the last one in an area covered by Avicennia schaueriana. In each habitat five sediment cores from 0-10 cm layer in an area of 10 m2, in the low tide of 0.0, were collected. The fifteen samples from each mangrove were pooled to form a single composite sample and DNA metagenomic extraction was carried out using the PowerMaxSoil DNA Extraction kit (MoBio Laboratories, Carlsbad, CA, USA) following the manufacturer''s protocol.

SRP030775	Stordalen mire environmental genomics Metagenome	Permafrost environments are major carbon reservoirs undergoing dramatic changes as a result of increasing global temperatures. Thawing promotes microbial degradation of cryo-sequestered and new carbon leading to the biogenic production of methane, creating a positive feedback to climate change. The microbial communities responsible for this methane production remain largely unstudied. Here we use a combination of culture-independent molecular techniques and biogeochemistry to determine microbial community composition and function, and methane fluxes along a permafrost thaw gradient in northern Sweden. Methanogenic populations in partially thawed sites (Sphagnum-dominated bogs) were frequently dominated by a single phylotype, â€˜Candidatus Methanoflorens stordalenmirensisâ€™ gen. nov. sp. nov., belonging to the uncultivated lineage â€œRC-IIâ€, which comprised up to 98% of the archaeal community. Metagenomic sequencing of a bog sample enriched in this population led to the recovery of its near-complete genome, revealing the genes necessary for hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis. Metaproteomics indicated that this archaeon is active in situ and highly expresses its methanogenesis proteins. Methane carbon isotope data are consistent with hydrogenotrophic production of methane in the partially thawed site. In addition to permafrost wetlands, the RC-II lineage (Candidatus Methanoflorentaceae fam. nov.) is widespread in high methane-flux habitats including peatlands, freshwater sediments and rice-paddies, suggesting that this lineage is both prevalent and a major contributor to global methane production. In thawing permafrost, â€˜M. stordalenmirensisâ€™ appears to be a key mediator of methane-based positive feedback to climate warming.	SRR1010317

ERP009306	Metagenomic sequencing revealed altered microbiota in microscopic colitis	Microscopic colitis (MC) is a disorder characterized by chronic non-bloody diarrhea predominantly affecting elderly smoking women. Since an altered microbiota is reported in several immune mediated diseases and since MC affects the gut, our hypothesis was that the microbiota would be altered in patients with MC. The bacterial microbiomes was analysed by DNA sequencing (Illumina Hiseq2000). Patients with MC had a marked reduction of Veruccomicrobia (Akkermansia spp) compared to healthy individuals. Specific Akkermansia spp PCR performed on the 10 patients and 7 controls and on an additional 5 female MC-patients confirmed the decreased levels of Akkermansia in MC patients.

''12). This site exists in a back arc basin that contains mainly marine deposited nanofossil ooze that was deposited at a rate of 5.6 cm/kyr. The uniquely low geothermal gradient (2.1Â° C/100 m) allows gas hydrate to exist deep into the sediment column (300 to 600 meters below seafloor or mbsf) making the gas hydrate deposits found at this location among the deepest discovered to date. Geologic horizons demarcate this gas hydrate occurrence zone (GHOZ) as evidenced by increasing porosity from 50% to 63% at 300 mbsf and a seismically observed bottom-simulating reflector where the methane is believed to exist as a free gas at 600 meters below seafloor (mbsf). Biogenic methane is present above 600 mbsf and transitioning to mixed thermogenic/ biogenic methane. In addition, the Andaman Sea sediments are unique because the total organic carbon (TOC) is less than 1% by weight, while other similar continental margins where microbiology has been examined contain 1-11% TOC (Meister et al. ''05).	SRR1964815,SRR1964816,SRR1964817

SRP038693	Freshwater Reservoir Amadorio Metagenome	he study aims to describe the microbial community of a freshwater reservoir using high throughput sequencing. The reservoir is called Amadorio and is located in the region of Alicante, Spain.  Water was collected and filtered through a series of polycarbonate filters, a 20 micron prefilter, 5 micron (for large cells and eukaryotes) and 0.22 or 0.1 micron (for planktonic microbes). The data deposited in this bioproject originates from two independent samplings. For one sample,  DNA was extracted from the 0.1 micron filter (small, planktonic fraction) and 5 micron  (large, particulate fraction) filters to obtain genomic DNA for two different size fractions of the microbial community. Both these samples were sequenced by a shotgun metagenomic approach. For the second sample, DNA from the 0.22 micron was cloned into a  fosmid library. Approximately 400 fosmids were pooled in a single batch and a total of 14 batches (total ca. 5500 fosmids) were sequenced. All sequencing was done using Illumina HiSeq 2000. Metagenomic reads from each batch are available within this bioproject.

ERP014885	DNA evidence of bowhead whale exploitation by Greenlandic Paleo-Inuit 4000 years ago	The demographic history of Greenland is characterized by oscillations since the first humans arrived 4500 years ago. Our current understanding of these extinct cultures relies primarily on preserved fossils found in their archaeological deposits. However, some exploited taxa, though economically important, comprise only a small fraction of these sub-fossil assemblages. We reconstruct a comprehensive record of past subsistence economies in Greenland by sequencing ancient DNA from four well-described midden deposits. Our results confirm that the species found in the fossil record, like harp seal and ringed seal were a vital part of Inuit subsistence, but also add a new dimension with evidence that caribou, walrus and whale species played a more prominent role for the survival of Paleo-Inuit cultures than previously reported. Most notably, we report the first tangible evidence of bowhead whale exploitation by the Saqqaq culture 4000 years ago.

ERP001911	Gut microbiomes of Malawian twin pairs discordant for kwashiorkor	Epidemiologic studies have emphasized that food insecurity is not the sole cause of malnutrition. To investigate the role of the gut microbiome, we studied 317 Malawian twins during the first 3 years of life. Discordance for moderate or severe malnutrition was 43%, and not affected by zygosity or gender. Both co-twins in a discordant pair with kwashiorkor were treated with a peanut-based, ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF). Time-series metagenomic studies of 9 same-gender pairs who remained healthy and 13 who became discordant for kwashiorkor revealed that RUTF produced a transient maturation in the representation of metabolic functions in kwashiorkor microbiomes that regressed shortly after cessation of RUTF. Previously frozen fecal communities from several discordant pairs were transplanted into gnotobiotic mice who were given a representative, nutrient-deficient Malawi diet followed by RUTF and then the Malawi diet. Metagenomic, mass spectrometric and NMR studies revealed that the combination of a Malawi diet and a kwashiorkor microbiome produced marked weight loss in the gnotobiotic mice, accompanied by substantial perturbations in amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism that were only transiently ameliorated with RUTF. These findings implicate the gut microbiome as a causal factor in a severe form of undernutrition and suggest that long-term nutritional support may be required to correct persistent metabolic defects arising from microbiome dysfunction in undernourished children.

ERP012797	Genomic and in situ investigations of the novel uncultured Chloroflexi associated with 0092 morphotype filamentous bulking in activated sludge	Overgrowth of filamentous bacteria in activated sludge wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) leads to impaired sludge settleability, a condition known as bulking, which is a common operational problem worldwide. Filaments with the Eikelboom 0092 morphotype are commonly associated with such bulking episodes. Members of the uncultured B45 phylotype, which is embraced within the phylum Chloroflexi, were recently shown to exhibit this morphology. Although these organisms are among the most abundant populations recorded in activated sludge processes, nothing is known about their metabolic characteristics. In this study, a genome sequence, representing the phylotype, was retrieved from a metagenome generated from an activated sludge WWTP plant. The genome consisted of two chromosomes and one plasmid, which were 4.0, 1.0, and 0.04 Mbps in size, respectively. A metabolic model was constructed for this organism, based on annotation of its genome, showing its ability to generate energy by aerobic respiration, utilizing oxygen, nitrite, or nitrous oxide as electron acceptors, or by fermentation of sugars. This model was validated partially in situ. The provisional name of Candidatus â€œPromineofilum breveâ€ is proposed for this species. This study represents the first detailed information on an uncultured genus of filamentous organisms from activated sludge.

ERP002194	Gene-targeted metagenomic analysis of 1-4-a-glucan branching enzyme gene profiles among human and animal fecal microbiota	Organismal and functional aspects of the gut microbiota are of great interest in human microbiome studies. Although 16S rRNA gene sequence-based phylogenetic and whole-genome shotgun (WGS) data analysis are frequently used for assessment of genetic diversity, these techniques pose biological challenges for in-depth understanding of metabolic genes related to the gut microbiota. Phylogenetic analyses of 16S rRNA gene sequences provide limited information on their involvement in metabolic pathways. WGS data provide useful information on metabolic functions; however, this technique generates a large amount of data unrelated to the gene of interest at a high cost. In this study, we employed a metagenomic approach targeting the 1-4-a-glucan branching enzyme (gBE) gene of four host species (chicken, cow, pig, and human). Glycoside hydrolases (GHs) are key enzymes associated with the gut microbiota and its metabolic functions. The gBE gene, belonging to GH family 13, is responsible for glycogen branching and determines its solubility and subsequent catabolic metabolism. In addition to 16S rRNA gene-based phylogenetic analyses, an average of 1,200 reads of gBE were generated from fecal microbiota samples from human (n = 16), chicken (n = 18), cow (n = 15) and pig (n = 20). Each of the hosts showed distinct 16S rRNA and gBE sequence profiles. Human and pig exhibited both unique and common characteristics of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and gBE profiles. Interestingly, the OTUs identified from the 16S rRNA and gBE gene sequences differed among the host species, suggesting the presence of different gBE genes in the same OTU in 16S rRNA sequences of different vertebrate hosts. Our data suggest that gene-targeted metagenomic analysis is useful for an in-depth understanding of the diversity of a particular gene of interest. Moreover, specific OTUs in the gut may contain metabolic genes the characteristics of which differ according to host genetic background and/or diet.	ERR248260,ERR248261,ERR248262,ERR248263

SRP076549	Temporal stability in chronic wound microbiota is associated with poor healing	Microbial burden of chronic wounds is believed to play an important role in impaired healing and development of infection-related complications. However, clinical cultures have little predictive value of wound outcomes, and culture-independent studies have been limited by cross-sectional design and small cohort size. We systematically evaluated the temporal dynamics of the microbiota colonizing diabetic foot ulcers, a common and costly complication of diabetes, and its association with healing and clinical complications. Dirichlet multinomial mixture modeling, Markov chain analysis, and mixed-effect models were used to investigate shifts in the microbiota over time and its associations with healing. Here we show for the first time the temporal dynamics of the chronic wound microbiome. Microbiota community instability was associated with faster healing and improved outcomes. DFU microbiota were found to exist in one of four community types that experienced frequent and non-random transitions, which corresponded to the healing time. Exposure to systemic antibiotics destabilized the wound microbiota, rather than altering overall diversity or relative abundance of specific taxa. This study provides the first evidence that the dynamic wound microbiome is indicative of clinical outcomes and may be a valuable guide for personalized management and treatment of chronic wounds.

ERP010088	Metagenomic analysis of the upper bronchial tract microbiome in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and 'healthy' smoker controls	Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) may worsen with microbial changes in the respiratory tract but studies into taxonomic structure of the COPD lung microbiome have yielded equivocal results. This may reflect the poor resolving power of taxonomic classification when only based 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. We here report the metagenomic characterisation of COPD microbiome to more accurately reveal its species-level structure and functional capacity. The bacterial metagenomes within sputum samples from eight COPD patients and ten â€˜healthyâ€™ smokers (Controls) were sequenced and suggested increases in the abundance of bacterial species, particularly within Streptococcus in COPD. The functional capacity of the COPD lung microbiome indicated an increased capacity for bacterial growth, which could be an important feature in bacterial-associated acute exacerbations. Regression analyses correlated COPD severity (FEV1 % of predicted) with differences in the abundance of Streptococcus pneumonia and functional classifications related to a reduced capacity for bacterial sialic acid metabolism. Neither of these lung microbiome characteristics correlated with patient age or smoking pack history, further suggesting an association with COPD pathology. This study suggests that the COPD lung microbiome could be used in patient risk stratification and in identifying novel monitoring and treatment methods.

ERP012668	Microbiota-modulated metabolites shape the intestinal microenvironment by regulating NLRP6 inflammasome signaling	Host-microbiome co-evolution drives homeostasis and disease susceptibility, yet regulatory principles governing the integrated intestinal host-commensal microenvironment remain obscure. While inflammasome signaling participates in these interactions, its activators and microbiome-modulating mechanisms are unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the microbiota-associated metabolites taurine, histamine, and spermine shape the host-microbiome interface by co-modulating NLRP6 inflammasome signaling, epithelial IL-18 secretion, and downstream anti-microbial peptide (AMP) profiles. Distortion of this balanced AMP landscape by inflammasome deficiency drives dysbiosis development. Upon fecal transfer, colitis-inducing microbiota hijacks this microenvironment-orchestrating machinery through metabolite-mediated inflammasome suppression, leading to distorted AMP balance favoring its preferential colonization. Restoration of the metabolite-inflammasome-AMP axis reinstates a normal microbiota and ameliorates colitis. Together, we identify microbial modulators of the NLRP6 inflammasome and highlight mechanisms by which microbiome-host interactions cooperatively drive microbial community stability through metabolite-mediated innate immune modulation. Therefore, targeted â€˜postbioticâ€™ metabolomic intervention may restore a normal microenvironment, as treatment or prevention of dysbiosis-driven diseases.

The present study elucidated how nanomolar O2 concentrations affected nitrogen removal rates and expression of key nitrogen cycle genes in water from the eastern South Pacific OMZ, applying state-of-the-art 15N techniques and metatranscriptomics. Quantifying O2 sensitivity of these processes is essential for predicting through which pathways and in which environments, from wastewater treatment to the open oceans, nitrogen removal may occur.

We applied this framework to study the composition of indoor and outdoor air samples collected from locations in New York City (NYC), New York and in San Diego (SD), California. Since DNA yields were inadequate for sequencing, the DNA isolated from the samples was amplified to generate sufficient amounts for library construction. Sequence data generated from the libraries were used to study the taxonomic composition of the sampled microbial communities and the functional composition of their bacterial constituents.

SRP017847	Succession in the Gut Microbiome following Antibiotic and Antibody Therapies for Clostridium difficile	Antibiotic disruption of the intestinal microbiota may cause susceptibility to pathogens that is resolved by progressive bacterial outgrowth and colonization. Succession is central to ecological theory but not widely documented in studies of the vertebrate microbiome. Here, we study succession in the hamster gut after treatment with antibiotics and exposure to Clostridium difficile. C. difficile infection is typically lethal in hamsters, but protection can be conferred with neutralizing antibodies against the A and B toxins. We compare treatment with neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to treatment with vancomycin, which prolongs the lives of animals but ultimately fails to protect them from death. We carried out longitudinal deep sequencing analysis and found distinctive waves of succession associated with each form of treatment. Clindamycin sensitization prior to infection was associated with the temporary suppression of the previously dominant Bacteroidales and the fungus Saccinobaculus in favor of Proteobacteria. In mAb-treated animals, C. difficile proliferated before joining Proteobacteria in giving way to re-expanding Bacteroidales and the fungus Wickerhamomyces. However, the Bacteroidales lineages returning by day 7 were different from those that were present initially, and they persisted for the duration of the experiment. Animals treated with vancomycin showed a different set of late-stage lineages that were dominated by Proteobacteria as well as increased disparity between the tissue-associated and luminal cecal communities. The control animals showed no change in their gut microbiota. These data thus suggest different patterns of ecological succession following antibiotic treatment and C. difficile infection.

DRP000699	Metgenomic analysis of human gut microbiome in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS).	13 individual of Japanese patients with multiple sclerosis.  Microbial DNA was sequenced using a 454 GS FLX titanium (Roche).	DRR002665
SRP056054	A prospective, longitudinal analysis of the developing gut microbiome in infants en route to type 1 diabetes	This is a prospective, longitudinal collection of stool samples from infants at risk for disease. Infants from Finland and Estonia were recruited at birth based on HLA risk genotyping.

SRP002480	Gene-Environment Interactions at the Skin Surface	16S rRNA gene sequences amplified from subjects with eczema and age-matched healthy controls.  Microbes living in and on humans are ten times more numerous than human cells. Culture-based methods have been the primary techniques used to study microbes inhabiting humans; however, many species are not successfully grown in culture. The NIH Roadmap for Medical Research Human Microbiome Project (HMP) aims to investigate the microbes in the gastrointestinal tract, oral cavity, skin, vagina, and nares. The goal of the HMP is to comprehensively characterize the human microbiota and analyze its role in human health and disease.   The skin serves not only as a barrier against invading pathogens and moisture loss, but also as a host to microbial communities. The skin of an adult is an approximately 2 square meter surface with a myriad of microenvironments.  Atopic dermatitis (AD), more commonly known as eczema, is a common skin disorder that is exacerbated by Staphylococcus aureus colonization.  This study aims to investigate the skin microbiota of AD patients at specific timepoints (quiescence, disease flares, and post-treatment) to examine how disease state correlates with changes in the skin microflora.     The 16S small subunit ribosomal (rRNA) gene is present in every bacterial cell, serving as a universal marker. The gene is sufficiently conserved to allow accurate alignment but adequately varied to enable phylogenetic analyses. Sequencing via 16S rRNA-based phylotyping has been used to survey the bacterial microbes on the skin.  Initially, we will examine the bacterial diversity associated with AD using a 16S rRNA survey and later broadening to include fungi, viruses, archaea and mites. In addition, bacteria will be cultured on a wide variety of media and isolates representing both abundant and novel species will be selected for whole genome sequencing.  To characterize fungal diversity, we utilize two phylogenetic markers within the rDNA region: 18S rRNA and the Intervening Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) region.  Full microbial diversity will be explored with shotgun metagenomic sequencing.

ERP008874	Evaluation of unbiased RNAseq as a diagnostic method in influenza virus positive respiratory samples	Unbiased, non-targeted metagenomic RNA sequencing has the advantage to detect known as well as unknown sequences and thus can significantly improve the detection of viral, bacterial, parasitic and fungal sequences in public health settings. In particular, in only 30-40% of respiratory specimen from patients with acute respiratory illness conventional diagnostic methods successfully identify the putative pathogenic agent.  We applied unbiased metagenomic RNA sequencing (UMERS) to 24 diagnostic respiratory specimens (BAL, sputum and swab) of patients with seasonal influenza infection and 5 BAL samples from patients with pneumonia tested negative for Influenza to validate RNA sequencing as an unbiased, additional diagnostic method. We evaluated i) sensitivity and specificity, ii) the potential to retrieve comprehensive influenza virus genomic information and, iii) capability to detect known superinfecting pathogens. When compared to quantitative RT-PCR for Influenza virus sequences, UMERS displayed sensitivity and specificity values for BAL samples of 71 â€“ 83% and 100 % respectively. Complete influenza virus genomes could be assembled from 10 samples. Furthermore, in 3/24 samples additional viral pathogens could be detected and 2/24 samples showed significantly increased abundance of individual bacterial species known to cause superinfections during influenza virus infection. Thus, analysis of respiratory samples from known or suspected influenza patients by UMERS provides multiple parallel information of clinical relevance.

ERP015565	â€œCandidatus Propionivibrio aalborgensisâ€: a novel glycogen accumulating organism abundant in full-scale enhanced biological phosphorus removal plants	Enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) is widely used to remove phosphorus from wastewater. The process relies on polyphosphate accumulating organisms (PAOs) that are able to take up phosphorus in excess of what is needed for growth, whereby phosphorus can be removed from the wastewater by wasting the biomass. However, glycogen accumulating organisms (GAOs) may reduce the EBPR efficiency as they compete for substrates with PAOs, but do not store excessive amounts of polyphosphate. PAOs and GAOs are thought to be phylogenetically unrelated, with the model PAO being the betaproteobacterial â€œCandidatus Accumulibacter phosphatisâ€ (Accumulibacter) and the model GAO being the gammaproteobacterial â€œCandidatus Competibacter phosphatisâ€. Here, we report the discovery of a GAO from the genus Propionivibrio, which is closely related to Accumulibacter. Annotation of the Propionivibrio genome confirmed their potential for the GAO phenotype and a basic metabolic model is proposed for their metabolism in the EBPR environment.

SRP082560	subsurface metagenome Metagenome	The shale gas basins in the Ohio-Pennsylvania-New York region contain the largest natural gasreserves in the U.S. In 2012, over 7,000 Marcellus shale gas wells were active in Pennsylvania, and Ohio isexpecting a similar level of development in its deeper, Utica-Point Pleasant shale over the next 5 years.These shale have insufficient permeability to produce natural gas at economical rates, thus their developmentrequires horizontal drilling coupled to hydraulic fracturing, or â€œfrackingâ€. The hydraulic fracturing processinvolves wellbore detonation and high-pressure injection of large volumes (up to 20 million L) of freshwaterand sand mixed with chemical additives to propagate fissures in the shale matrix, maximizing the surfacearea for natural gas release to the wellbore. As a result of fracturing, larger flow paths and newly exposedshale surfaces offer greater biogeochemical gradients for microbial colonization with greater opportunitiesfor nutrient and genetic exchange. We know little about the indigenous microbial membership of Marcellusshale, but given current physicochemical conditions of this formation (depths > 1000m, pressures > than 50MPa, temperatures > 60ÂºC, 20% salt content, and pore sizes < 1 Âµm) we anticipate that organisms enrichedduring energy development will encode adaptations to these physical and geochemical conditions.

SRP062137	Composition and dynamics of the respiratory tract microbiome in intubated patients	Objective: Lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) is a major contributor to respiratory failure requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. LRTI during mechanical ventilation contributes to morbidity and mortality in intubated patients. We sought to understand the dynamics of respiratory tract microbiota following intubation and the relationship between microbial community structure and infection.    Design: Cohort study with longitudinal sampling.  Setting: Medical Intensive Care Unit at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania.    Subjects: 15 subjects with respiratory failure requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation.    Interventions: We sampled oropharyngeal (OP) and deep endotracheal (ET) secretions within 24 hours of intubation and every 48-72 hours thereafter. Bacterial community profiling was carried out by purifying DNA, PCR amplification of 16S rRNA gene sequences, deep sequencing, and bioinformatic community analysis.    Measurements and Main Results: Healthy subjects typically have diverse upper respiratory tract (URT) and lower respiratory tract (LRT) microbiota, where the LRT community is present in lower abundance and probably derived from the URT by microaspiration. In contrast, critically ill subjects had lower initial diversity at both sites. Diversity further diminished over time on the ventilator. In several subjects, the bacterial community was dominated by a single taxon over multiple time points. The clinical diagnosis of LRTI ascertained by chart review correlated with low community diversity and dominance of a single taxon. Dominant taxa matched clinical bacterial cultures where cultures were obtained and positive. In several cases, dominant taxa included bacteria not detected by culture, including Ureaplasma and Enterococcus.    Conclusions: Longitudinal analysis of respiratory tract microbiota in critically ill patients provides insight into the pathogenesis and diagnosis of LRTI. 16S rRNA gene sequencing of endotracheal aspirate samples holds promise for expanded pathogen identification.

ERP003686	Dispersal in microbes: fungi in indoor air are dominated by outdoor air and show dispersal limitation at short distances	The indoor microbiome is a complex system that is thought to depend on dispersal from the outdoor biome and the occupants' microbiome combined with selective pressures imposed by the occupants' behaviors and the building itself. We set out to determine the pattern of fungal diversity and composition in indoor air on a local scale and to identify processes behind that pattern. We surveyed airborne fungal assemblages within 1-month time periods at two seasons, with high replication, indoors and outdoors, within and across standardized residences at a university housing facility. Fungal assemblages indoors were diverse and strongly determined by dispersal from outdoors, and no fungal taxa were found as indicators of indoor air. There was a seasonal effect on the fungi found in both indoor and outdoor air, and quantitatively more fungal biomass was detected outdoors than indoors. A strong signal of isolation by distance existed in both outdoor and indoor airborne fungal assemblages, despite the small geographic scale in which this study was undertaken. Moreover, room and occupant behavior had no detectable effect on the fungi found in indoor air. These results show that at the local level, outdoor air fungi dominate the patterning of indoor air. More broadly, they provide additional support for the growing evidence that dispersal limitation, even on small geographic scales, is a key process in structuring the often-observed distance-decay biogeographic pattern in microbial communities.

This project aims to pilot detection of taxonomic and functional shifts with respect to diet and gastrointestinal disease status in a large prospective cohort: 1. We will establish a reliable and scalable collection method for the oral and gut microbiota. This will determine whether shippable collection kits are comparable to fresh frozen stool and/or saliva samples. 2. We will test the hypothesis that a Western dietary pattern correlates with microbiome community structures or functions enriched in inflammatory bowel disease in either the oral (saliva) or gut (stool) microbiota. By providing methodology to understand the human microbiome from the molecular to the population level, we hope to enable its future use as a diagnostic indicator and as a point of intervention to improve outcomes in IBD and other chronic diseases.

SRP036082	Prokaryotic population of a tar lake Amplicon library	Anaerobic microbial degradation of hydrocarbons influences the quality of oil resources and can lead to the generation of highly viscous bitumen. Previous work suggests such biodegradation mostly occurs at the interfaces of oil and water compartments. However, we show at the example of the worldâ€™s largest asphalt lake in Trinidad Tobago that microorganisms thrive in water droplets (1-5 Âµl) entrapped in oil. The water inclusions originate from deep subsurface formations and harbored complex methanogenic microbial communities actively degrading oil indicated by metabolites derived from oil-hydrocarbons. The large surface area of the water droplets associated with the 13,5 % water content of the oil reveals a currently underestimated potential for biodegradation of oil resources and an intriguing new and extreme habitat for microbial life in oil.

ERP001739	Follow-up of faecal microbiota in IBS patients	Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the most common functional                 gastrointestinal disorder in western countries. The definition and treatment of IBS                 is challenging due to its largely unknown aetiology and the variety of symptoms it                 can present. Previous studies on IBS suggest subtle alterations in the composition                 of intestinal microbiota. However, no consensus has been reached regarding the                 association between specific bacteria and IBS. To overcome the confusion introduced                 by inter-subject variability and heterogeneity within IBS that is problematic in                 cross-sectional studies, we undertook a longitudinal study that allowed us to                 compare samples from single patients at moments with different type and/or severity                 of symptoms. We present results for two IBS patients with diarrhoea subtype and the                 healthy relative of one of them. Faecal samples collected every two days the first                 week and then weekly over two months were analysed through metagenomic and                 metatranscriptomic approaches. Overall, we detect a greater instability of faecal                 microbiota in IBS patients when compared to the control, and even larger instability                 associated with acute diarrheoa. Bacterial composition and encoded functions were                 fairly stable throughout. On the contrary, the fraction of active bacteria varied                 markedly in time. Strong and quick compositional shifts were associated with                 relapse, although with low reproducibility between and within patients. Similarly,                 changes in the global pattern of gene expression characterized days of worsening,                 but we could not identify genes or functions associated with relapse. Our results                 confirm that the association of microbiota with IBS is rather weak.	ERR164434,ERR164437,ERR164445,ERR164447,ERR164449,ERR164451

ERP004168	Comparative freshwater metagenomics of Swedish and American lakes	Little is known about the diversity and structuring of freshwater microbial communities beyond the patterns revealed by tracing their distribution in the landscape with common taxonomic markers such as the ribosomal RNA. To address this gap in knowledge, metagenomes from temperate lakes were compared to selected marine metagenomes. Taxonomic analyses of rRNA genes in these freshwater metagenomes confirm the previously reported dominance of a limited subset of uncultured lineages of freshwater bacteria, whereas Archaea were rare. Diversification into marine and freshwater microbial lineages was also reflected in phylogenies of functional genes and there were also significant differences in functional beta-diversity. The pathways and functions that accounted for these differences are involved in osmoregulation, active transport, carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism. Moreover, predicted genes orthologous to active transporters and recalcitrant organic matter degradation were more common in microbial genomes from oligotrophic versus eutrophic lakes. This comparative metagenomic analysis allowed us to formulate a general hypothesis that oceanic- compared to freshwater-dwelling microorganisms, invest more in metabolism of amino acids and that strategies of carbohydrate metabolism differ significantly between marine and freshwater microbial communities.

ERP010635	Expanded Enteric Virome and Altered Bacterial Microbiome in Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome	The effect of HIV on the enteric DNA virome and bacterial microbiome is incompletely characterized. Here we sequenced virus-like particles and bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA genes in stool from 40 HIV-negative subjects, 42 HIV-infected subjects and 40 HIV-infected subjects on anti-retroviral therapy (ART) living in Uganda. CD4 T cell counts inversely correlated with plasma soluble CD14 (sCD14) levels, suggesting increased translocation of pro-inflammatory microbial products across the enteric mucosa with worsening immunodeficiency. Low CD4 T cell counts were associated with expansion of the eukaryotic DNA virome including adenoviruses and Anelloviruses and changes in the bacterial microbiome including increases in Enterobacteriaceae members and decreases in Ruminococci. Thus immunodeficiency in progressive HIV infection is associated with significant alterations in the human enteric virome and bacterial microbiome. These changes may contribute to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) enteropathy, translocation of pro-inflammatory materials across the intestinal mucosa and systemic inflammation associated with progression to AIDS.

SRP050044	Intestinal microbiota composition modulates choline bioavailability from diet and accumulation of the pro-atherogenic metabolite trimethylamine-N-oxide	Choline is a water-soluble nutrient essential for human life. Gut microbial metabolism of choline results in the production of trimethylamine (TMA), which upon absorption by the host is converted in the liver to trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO). Recent studies revealed that TMAO exacerbates atherosclerosis in mice, and positively correlates with the severity of this disease in human. However, which microbes contribute to TMA production in the human gut; the extent to which host factors, e.g., genotype and diet, affect TMA production and colonization of these microbes; as well as the effects TMA-producing microbes have on bioavailability of dietary choline remain largely unknown. We screened a collection of 78 sequenced human intestinal isolates encompassing the major phyla found in the human gut and identified eight strains capable of producing TMA from choline in vitro. Gnotobiotic mouse studies showed that TMAO accumulates in the serum of animals colonized with TMA-producing species, but not in the serum of animals colonized with intestinal isolates that do not generate TMA from choline in vitro. Remarkably, low levels of colonization of TMA-producing bacteria significantly reduced choline levels available to the host. This effect was more pronounced as the abundance of TMA-producing bacteria increased. Our findings provide a framework for designing strategies aimed at changing the representation or activity of TMA-producing bacteria in the human gut and suggest the TMA producing status of the gut microbiota should be considered when making recommendations about choline intake requirements for humans. Overall design: Examination of community composition and host (gender and strain)/environmental (diet) factors on TMAO accumulation in gnotobiotic mice.

ERP016338	Functional and taxonomic profiling of microbial communities in caves of the Algarve, Southern Portugal.	This project is designed to deliver dense genetic data sets and sharply improve our understanding of microbial diversity, functioning and biogeography across cave ecosystems. The distinct Algarve karst region (southern Portugal) will be used as a model system in an unprecedented metagenomics quest for the hidden microbial taxa, genes and metabolic pathways present in pristine/undisturbed cave sediments. By overcoming the typical hurdles of traditional microbial cultivation approaches, and targeting cave microbial communities in a DNA-based, cultivation-independent fashion instead, this project will shed new light on the metabolic potential and life-style of hitherto â€œunculturableâ€ microorganisms that inhabit these unique settings. Extensive data acquisition on key functional genes will ultimately permit future design of novel microbial cultivation platforms based on the predicted metabolism of cave sediment microorganisms. Furthermore, this analysis as a whole will considerably augment our current, limited knowledge of microbial diversity and function in these distinct ecosystems, which remain under-appreciated despite their relevance for global biogeochemistry.

ERP008921	Quality control of microbiota metagenomics by k-mer analysis with SOLiD sequencing technology	The biological and clinical consequences of the tight interactions between host and microbiota are rapidly being unravelled by next generation sequencing technologies and sophisticated bioinformatics, also referred to as microbiota metagenomics. The recent success of metagenomics has created a demand to rapidly apply the technology to large case-control cohort studies and to studies of microbiota from various habitats, including habitats relatively poor in microbes. It is therefore of foremost importance to enable a robust and rapid quality assessment of metagenomic data from samples that challenge present technological limits (sample numbers and size). Here we demonstrate that the distribution of overlapping k-mers of metagenome sequence data predicts sequence quality as defined by gene distribution and efficiency of sequence mapping to a reference gene catalogue. We used serial dilutions of gut microbiota metagenomic datasets to generate well defined high to low quality metagenomes. We also analysed a collection of 52 microbiota derived metagenomes. We demonstrate that k-mer distributions of metagenomic sequence data identify sequence contaminations, such as sequences derived from â€œemptyâ€ ligation products. Of note, k-mer distributions were also able to predict the frequency of sequences mapping to a reference gene catalogue not only for the well-defined serial dilution datasets, but also for 52 human gut microbiota derived metagenomic datasets. We propose that k-mer analysis of raw metagenome sequence reads should be implemented as a first quality assessment prior to more extensive bioinformatical analysis, such as sequence filtering and gene mapping. With the rising demand for metagenomic analysis of microbiota it is crucial to provide tools for rapid and efficient decision making. This will eventually lead to a faster turn-around time, improved analytical quality including sample quality metrics and a significant cost reduction. Finally, improved quality assessment will have a major impact on the robustness of biological and clinical conclusions drawn from metagenomic studies.

SRP000101	Metagenomics and metatranscriptomics of marine plankton under conditions of ocean acidification	The dissolution of anthropogenic CO2 from the atmosphere into the oceans will decrease surface pH by 0.3 units over the next 100 years (IPCC 2007); the phenomenon is referred to as ocean acidification (OA). There are concerns that OA will affect marine microorganisms, with significant impacts on marine biogeochemical cycling. To investigate the impact of this on marine microorganisms, a mesocosm experiment was set-up in a Norwegian Fjord in May 2006.   Six bags containing 11,000 L of sea water were suspended in a Coastal Fjord.  CO2 was bubbled through three of these bags to simulate ocean acidification conditions in the year 2100. The other three bags were bubbled with air. A phytoplankton bloom was induced in all six bags and phytoplankton, bacterioplankton and physiochemical characteristics were measured and analyzed over a 18 day period. Water samples from the peak of the phytoplankton bloom were isolated and used to follow the decline of the phytoplankton bloom. Nucleic acid extractions were performed to analyse bacterial diversity and functionality using 454 metagenomics and 454 metatranscriptomics.   Sequencing the metatranscriptome can provide information about the response of organisms to varying environmental conditions. A methodology for obtaining random whole-community mRNA from a complex microbial assemblage using pyrosequencing was used. The metatranscriptome had, with minimum contamination by ribosomal RNA, significant coverage of abundant transcripts, and included significantly more potentially novel proteins than in the metagenome.    Four 454 metatranscriptomic datasets and four 454 metagenomic datasets have been produced. These were derived from 4 samples: Day 1, High CO2 Bag and Day 1, Present Day Bag, refer to the metatranscriptomes from the peak of the bloom; Day 2, High CO2 Bag and Day 2, Present Day Bag, refer to the metatranscriptomes following the decline of the bloom.

SRP001475	The microbiota controls asymptomatic pathogen excretion after non-typhoidal Salmonella diarrhea	Many enteropathogenic bacteria target the mammalian gut. The mechanisms protecting the host from infection are poorly understood. We have studied the protective functions of secretory antibodies (sIgA) and the microbiota, using a mouse model for S. typhimurium diarrhea. This pathogen is a common cause of diarrhea in humans world-wide. S. typhimurium (S. tm(att), sseD) causes a self-limiting gut infection in streptomycin-treated mice. After 40 days, all animals had overcome the disease, developed a sIgA response, and most had cleared the pathogen from the gut lumen. sIgA limited pathogen access to the mucosal surface and protected from gut inflammation in challenge infections. This protection was O-antigen specific, as demonstrated with pathogens lacking the S. typhimurium O-antigen (wbaP, S. enteritidis) and sIgA-deficient mice (TCRÃŸ(-/-)d(-/-), J(H) (-/-), IgA(-/-), pIgR(-/-)). Surprisingly, sIgA-deficiency did not affect the kinetics of pathogen clearance from the gut lumen. Instead, this was mediated by the microbiota. This was confirmed using 'L-mice' which harbor a low complexity gut flora, lack colonization resistance and develop a normal sIgA response, but fail to clear S. tm(att) from the gut lumen. In these mice, pathogen clearance was achieved by transferring a normal complex microbiota. Thus, besides colonization resistance (?=?pathogen blockage by an intact microbiota), the microbiota mediates a second, novel protective function, i.e. pathogen clearance. Here, the normal microbiota re-grows from a state of depletion and disturbed composition and gradually clears even very high pathogen loads from the gut lumen, a site inaccessible to most "classical" immune effector mechanisms. In conclusion, sIgA and microbiota serve complementary protective functions. The microbiota confers colonization resistance and mediates pathogen clearance in primary infections, while sIgA protects from disease if the host re-encounters the same pathogen. This has implications for curing S. typhimurium diarrhea and for preventing transmission.	SRR031071

SRP062071	Oil production facilty fluids Raw sequence reads	With limited oil reserves, aging infrastructure, and our increasing demand for energy, determining the role of microorganisms in reservoir souring and corrosion has become a priority for the petroleum industry. The microbiology of two Alaska North Slope oil production facilities, Kuparuk and Alpine, was investigated by characterizing the microbial communities, microbially derived metabolites indicative of hydrocarbon biodegradation, and metagenomes. Strictly anaerobic, thermophilic members of the Synergistes, and Firmicutes dominated at Kuparuk. Mesophilic, facultatively-anaerobic members of the Deltaproteobacteria or Gammaproteobacteria dominated at Alpine. Almost all samples contained metabolites indicative of hydrocarbon degradation. Temperature and differential facility management practices are a significant driver of microbial community composition and microbially-induced degradation of hydrocarbons. In this study, metagenomes representative of the two oil production facilities were used to identify genes involved in hydrocarbon degradation pathways and begin to link microbial community structure and detected putative metabolites of hydrocarbon degradation.

SRP068383	Reactor4-Electrobiome	Electrosynthetic microbiomes use electrodes as a sole electron donor and carbon dioxide as a sole carbon source to produce hydrogen and organic compounds. This system was used to test the hypothesis that a decrease in reactor pH would correlate with increased production of hydrogen due to the thermodynamic dependence of hydrogen formation on pH. Biocathodes were poised at -600 mV vs. SHE and as the pH decreased due to either the application of a salt gradient across the cation exchange membrane, the accumulation of organic acids, or addition of HCl, the hydrogen production rate increased >100-fold. Acetate production ceased when the pH was near 5 or lower. Following repeated exposure to low pH, the microbiome produced acetate (~5-15 mM/day) and high amounts of hydrogen (>1 mol per liter of catholyte volume per day) after a return to near neutral pH (~6.5). Up to 1300 mM/day hydrogen, 16.9 mM/day formate and 51.9 mM/day acetate were produced when the biocathode potential was then lowered to -800 mV. In yield tests with graphite rod electrodes poised at -600 mV, the current density per biomass was 6.5 Â± 1.2 A/g of electrode-attached protein. Cyclic voltammetry of the rod biocathodes indicated a 250 mV decrease in the hydrogen overpotential due to the presence and action of the microbiome and a maximum current density normalized to a cathode surface area of up to 12.2 mA/cm2 at -765 mV. The overall result of the repeated exposure to low pH was the development of a microbial community (>90% Acetobacterium plus Desulfovibrio and Sulfurospirillum) on the electrode that produced up to 2.6 kg/m3/day hydrogen with 1 kg H2 Ëœ 1 gal gasoline equivalent, and 3.1 kg/m3/day acetate with 1.5 kg of CO2 captured per kg of acetate produced.

ERP006107	PHOTOHETEROPHY IN A MESOSCALE ANTICYCLONIC EDDY IN THE EASTERN MEDITERRANEAN SEA	Mesoscale eddies are semi-closed rotating water bodies with distinct physico-chemical properties and are a widespread phenomenon in the worldâ€™s oceans. Previous studies found that eddies can affect phytoplankton and bacterioplankton community structure, primary productivity and nitrogen fixation. A considerable fraction of the marine bacterioplankton consists of photoheterhophs. These bacteria can use light to generate biochemical energy for transport and metabolic needs. Unlike photoautotrophs they depend on organic carbon for growth and biomass production. Photoheterotrophy can potentially enhance bacterial growth and/or survival in oligotrophic oceanic conditions. A common group of photoheterotrophs consists of proteorhodopsin (pr) â€“ bearing bacteria. The pr gene occurs in diverse microbial taxa including SAR11, a dominant Alphaproteobacteria clade. We hypothesize that anticyclonic eddies, which facilitate nutrient poor conditions by downwelling surface water, favor photoheterhophy. In November 2013 we conducted an oceanographic survey aboard R/V Mediterranean Explorer with the goal to assess the abundance, diversity and expression of photoheterophic genes in an anticyclonic eddy in the ultra-oligotrophic Eastern Mediterranean Sea. The results of this study will shed light on the potential role of physical and chemical gradients created by mesoscale eddies on changes in photoheterotrophic communities, which can have global effects on ocean biogeochemistry and energy flow.

SRP001793	Permafrost metagenome	The fate of the carbon stocked in permafrost soils following global warming and permafrost thaw is of major concern in view of the potential for increased CH4 and CO2 emissions from these soils. Complex carbon compound degradation and greenhouse gas emissions are due to soil microbial communities, but their composition and functional potential in permafrost soils are largely unknown.    A 2m deep permafrost and its overlying active layer soil were subjected to metagenome sequencing, quantitative PCR, and microarray analyses. The active layer soil and 2m permafrost soil microbial community structures were very similar, with Actinobacteria being the dominant phylum. The two soils also possessed a highly similar spectrum of functional genes, especially when compared to other already published metagenomes. Key genes related to methane generation, methane oxidation and organic matter degradation were highly diverse for both soils in the metagenomic libraries and some (e.g. pmoA) showed relatively high abundance in qPCR assays. Genes related to nitrogen fixation and ammonia oxidation, which could have important roles following climatic change in these nitrogen-limited environments, showed low diversity but high abundance. The 2m permafrost soil showed lower abundance and diversity for all the assessed genes and taxa. Experimental biases were also evaluated and showed that the whole community genome amplification technique used caused large representational biases in the metagenomic libraries.    This study described for the first time the detailed functional potential of permafrost-affected soils and detected several genes and microorganisms that could have crucial importance following permafrost thaw.  Sequences deposited into the Sequence Read Archive can be found using the Project data link.	SRR034817,SRR034818

SRP083067	sediment metagenome Metagenome	In this project we will investigate the metagenome of the Tonga Trench, at 9.2km water depth and up to 2 m sediment depth. Species of hadal fauna are restricted to single or adjacent trenches and as a result trenches have been referred to as â€œzoographic provincesâ€. Put another way, trenches are biogeographically constrained â€œinverted islands of biodiversityâ€. At this time it is not clear how different trench microbial communities are distinct from one another or from those present in bathypelagic and abyssal regions. As trenches are an extremely unique ecosystem from the pelagic environment, we anticipate that sediments from within trenches will be equally unique and organisms from the Tonga Trench will show unique adaptations to their environment, which can be determined from comparative sequence analysis.

As microbial communities may be heavily structured by establishing vegetation, we included non-vegetated soils as well as soils from underneath four plant species with differing mycorrhizal ecologies (Abies lasiocarpa, ectomycorrhizal; Luetkea pectinata, arbuscular mycorrhizal; Phyllodoce empetriformis, ericoid mycorrhizal; Saxifraga ferruginea, non-mycorrhizal). Our main objectives were to contrast fungal and bacterial successional dynamics and community assembly as well as to decouple the effects of plant establishment and time since deglaciation on microbial trajectories using high throughput sequencing.

ERP013793	Light-dependent microbial metabolisms drive carbon fluxes on glacier surfaces	Biological processes on glacier surfaces affect glacier reflectance, influence surface energy budget and glacier response to climate warming, and determine glacier carbon exchange with the atmosphere. Currently, carbon balance of supraglacial environment is assessed as the balance between the activity of oxygenic phototrophs and the respiration rate of heterotrophic organisms. Here we present a metagenomic analysis of tiny wind-blown supraglacial sediment (cryoconite) from Baltoro (Pakistani Karakoram) and Forni (Italian Alps) glaciers providing evidence for the occurrence in these environments of different and previously neglected metabolic pathways. Indeed, we observed high abundance of heterotrophic anoxygenic phototrophs, suggesting that light might directly supplement the energy demand of some bacterial strains allowing them to use as carbon source organic molecules which otherwise would be respired. Furthermore, data suggest that CO2 could be produced also by microbiologically mediated oxidation of CO, which is produced in snow by photodegradation of organic matter.

ERP004560	Dysfunctional gut microbiota drives chronic immune activation in HIV-treated individuals	An altered interplay between gut mucosa and gut microbiota during treated HIV infection possibly contributes to increased bacterial translocation and chronic immune activation, which are predictors of morbidity and mortality. In a cohort of HIV-infected individuals on succesful antiretroviral therapy (ART) without comorbidities and in healthy controls we determined a number of systemic markers of innate and adaptive immunity. DNA was extracted from stool samples and amplicons of 16S rRNA and whole genome shot-gun sequences were analyzed, and the genus and pathways that characterized the microbiota of HIV-infected individuals were determined. HIV-infected subjects harbored a dysbiotic fecal microbiota, characterized by high levels of disease-associated bacteria, an increment of Gram-negative species and particularly by an abundance of Prevotella and Succinibivrio genera and a depletion of Bacteriodes and Faecalibaterium. This dysbiosis was related to an altered functional profile, including LPS biosynthesis â€“a source for systemic inflammationâ€“, glutathione metabolism, â€“a bacterial mechanism to neutralize local oxidative stressâ€“, and several inflammatory pathways. Using Bayesian network modeling, we determined that the dysbiotic bacterial community and the correlated altered metabolic pathways was associated with markers of immune dysfuntion, including impaired thymic output, heightened bactericidal-permeability increasing protein â€“a marker of bacterial translocation and a severe predictor of severe coronary atherosclerosis-, soluble CD14 â€“a marker of monocyte activation- and T-cell activation. Hence, the HIV-mediated breakdown of the gut mucosa is associated to a shift in the composition and function of gut microbiota that is not reverted by ART, even in subjects without comorbidities and optimal immunovirological response. This dysbiotic microbiota likely contributes to chronic innate and adaptive immune activation. Hence, strategies aimed at shaping the gut microbiota deserve further attention in the setting of treated HIV infection.

SRP003153	New Dominant Groups Along A Salinity Gradient	We describe community structure of two hypersaline solar salterns, an intermediate salinity pond (19%) and the other a crystallizer pond (37%) using pyrosequencing.  The analyes of these large metagenomes (nearly 784 Mb), in combination with previously available datasets along the salinity gradient confirmed known trends e.g. the vast dominance of the square archaeon Haloquadratum walsbyi, but also revealed novel, dominant and previously unsuspected microbial groups. We describe for the first time, a low GC actinobacterial group abundant in low and intermediate salinity systems. The surprising diversity of the intermediate salinity habitat was also reflected in discovery of microbes that were not known to have halophilic tendencies e.g. Clavibacter, Gramella. Stringent metagenomic assembly revealed the a dominant  novel low-GC euryarchaeota and another as yet unidentified gammaproteobacteria. Single cell sequencing of an archaeal genome obtained using multiple displacement amplification yielded a draft genome which indicated a photoheterotrophic, and polysaccharide degrading lifestyle of an abundant low GC euryarchaote, related to Nanohaloarchaea, with the lowest GC content described so far for any euryarchaeote. The assembled metagenomic contigs of the high GC gammaproteobacterium indicated that it is most closely related to the halophilic genus Alkalilimnicola and the non-halophilic genus Nitrococcus and is likely a heterotroph. These unexpected discoveries reveal the utility of an unbiased metagenomic approach to understanding and describing even previously well described microbial community assemblages.

SRP003237	16S rRNA analysis of bacterial communities of forest and grassland sites located in the German Biodiversity Exploratory SchwÃ¤bische Alb	Soil bacteria are important components for nearly all biogeochemical cycles in terrestrial ecosystems and participate in most nutrient transformations in soil. In contrast to the importance of soil bacteria for ecosystem functions, we understand little how different management types affect the soil bacterial community composition. We used pyrosequencing-based analysis of the V2-V3 16S rRNA gene region to identify changes in bacterial diversity and community structure in nine forest and nine grassland soils under six different management types (three replicates each) from the SchwÃ¤bische Alb (southwestern Germany). The data set comprised 598,962 sequences that were affiliated to the domain Bacteria. The number of classified sequences per sample ranged from 23,515 to 39,259. The dominant taxonomic groups across all samples (> 1% of all sequences) were Acidobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, Deltaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, and Firmicutes. Significant variations in relative abundances of bacterial phyla, including Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, Cyanobacteria, and Alphaproteobacteria, between the land use types forest and grassland were observed. At the genus level, differences were also recorded for the dominant genera Phenylobacter, Polyangium, Bacillus, Kribbella, Agromyces, and Defluviicoccus. The separate analysis of bacterial community composition in forest and grassland soils revealed strong correlations of relative abundances of bacterial groups at different taxonomic levels and soil pH, but little or no relationships to the management type and other soil properties were found. A pH effect was recorded for the Bacteroidetes, Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, Acidobacteria (subgroups 1, 4, 6, 13, 16, 17, and 22), Caulobacterales, and Dyella in forest soils, and for acidobacterial subgroup 3 and Acetobacteraceae in forest as well as in grassland soils. In addition, soil bacterial community structure showed significant differences between beech and spruce forest soils. Thus, soil pH and tree species were the major drivers of bacterial community composition in forest soils.	SRR125615,SRR125617
SRP103729	SPRUCE peat methagenome Raw sequence reads	The objective of this study was to characterize microbial metabolic potential in an ombrotrophic peatland in the Marcell Experimental Forest, Minnesota, USA. The SPRUCE experiment is the primary component of the Terrestrial Ecosystem Scientific Focus Area of ORNL''s Climate Change Program, focused on terrestrial ecosystems and the mechanisms that underlie their responses to climatic change. The manipulation will evaluate the response of the existing biological communities to a range of warming levels from ambient to +9Â°C, provided via large, modified open-top chambers. The ambient and +9Â°C warming treatments will also be conducted at elevated CO2 (in the range of 800 to 900 ppm). Both direct and indirect effects of these experimental perturbations will be analyzed to develop and refine models needed for full Earth system analyses.These samples were collected prior to the 1st stage of heating	SRR5440529,SRR5440530,SRR5440531,SRR5440532,SRR5440533,SRR5440534,SRR5440535

ERP010539	A generalizable approach is used to identify fitness determinants for multiple bacterial strains simultaneously in a model human gut microbiota, obtain gene-level characterization of their niches and responses to diet change, and design prebiotics for precision microbiota manipulation.	Defining the mechanisms critical for maintaining the highly adaptive and durable relationship between the human gut microbiota and its host is necessary if we are to understand how this community contributes to our health status, and how it can be manipulated to promote wellness. To help address this challenge, we generated libraries of tens of thousands of transposon (Tn) mutants for each of four human gut Bacteroides strains, two of which represented the same species. These libraries were introduced into singly-caged adult germ-free mice as part of a 15-member artificial human gut microbiota containing 11 other wild-type bacterial species. Mice received one of two distinct diets, or an ordered sequence of both. Multi-taxon INsertion Sequencing (INSeq) provided (i) a digital readout of the remarkably consistent pattern of community assembly, (ii) identified shared as well as species-, strain-, and diet-specific fitness determinants associated with a variety of metabolic/nutrient processing pathways, including those involving amino acids, carbohydrates and vitamins/cofactors, (iii) enabled quantitative gene-level measurement of the resiliency of the responses to diet perturbations, (iv) revealed that arabinoxylan, the most common hemicellulose in cereals, could be used to deliberately manipulate the representation of a prominent community member, Bacteroides cellulosilyticus WH2, and (v) defined the niche adjustments of this and the other Bacteroides to arabinoxylan supplementation of a high fat diet. The approach described for mapping microbial fitness landscapes in multiple strains simultaneously in a given community context should facilitate discovery efforts aimed at identifying the niches of microbiota members, as well as ways to deliberately reshape community structure and function through dietary interventions.

NGS of genomic DNA was used to identify putative centromeric repeats, while RNAseq allowed us to identify and characterize the CENH3 gene of Rhynchospora pubera, our model species. An antibody recognizing the holocentromeres of that species was then designed. ChIP-seq was used to validate the association of the centromeric repeat candidates, a satellite DNA (Tyba) and a centromeric retrotransposon (CRRh), to the functional centromeric nucleosomes from a holocentric species. Finally, assembly of sequenced BACs containing Tyba centromeric tandem repeat was used to examine the properties of the multiple centromeric units found.

SRP081086	Immature Compost Filter Cake	In the sugar mills, is generated in large quantities a by-product of the process called filter cake. Especially rich in phosphorus and water, this by-product is used as a natural fertilizer in the soil and in compost. However, the composting needs is human and high operational material and therefore not all plants can have the resources to perform such a process. This procedure aims to stir from time to time the material in the composting process in order to reduce the system temperature and control the proliferation of anaerobic microorganisms. An alternative is to filter cake batteries and leave it to time, which provides the development of a thermophilic microbial community and anaerobic the first weeks. This anaerobic microbial community, are responsible for consuming the nutrients that could be available to the plants when the resultant compound was used as fertilizer in soil. In this study, we address the analysis of microbial communities derived from immature compost filter cake aged 60 days.	SRR4014828
ERP015121	Authentication of herbal supplements using NGS	Abstract: DNA-based testing has been gaining acceptance as a tool for authentication of a wide range of food products; however, its applicability for testing of herbal supplements remains controversial. We utilized Sanger and Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) for taxonomic authentication of fifteen herbal supplements representing three different producers from five medicinal plants: Echinacea purpurea, Valeriana officinalis, Ginkgo biloba, Hypericum perforatum and Trigonella foenum-graecum. Experimental design included three modifications of DNA extraction, two lysate dilutions, Internal Amplification Control, and multiple negative controls to exclude background contamination. Ginkgo supplements were also analyzed using HPLC-MS for the presence of active medicinal components. All supplements yielded DNA from multiple species, rendering Sanger sequencing results for rbcL and especially for ITS2 regions uninterpretable or not reproducible between experimental replicates. Overall DNA from the manufacturer-listed medicinal plants was successfully detected in seven out of eight supplements represented by dry herb form, while low or poor DNA recovery due to degradation was observed in most plant extracts (none detected by Sanger; three out of seven â€“ by NGS). NGS analysis also revealed a diverse community of fungi, known to be associated with live plant material and/or the fermentation process used in the production of plant extracts. HPLC-MS testing demonstrated that Ginkgo supplements with degraded DNA contained ten key medicinal components. Quality control of herbal supplements should utilize synergetic approach targeting both bioactive components and DNA, especially for standardized extracts with potentially degraded DNA. The NGS workflow developed in this study enables reliable detection of plant and fungal DNA and can be utilized by manufacturers for quality assurance of raw plant materials, contamination control during the production process, and the final product. Interpretation of results should involve an interdisciplinary approach taking into account the processes involved in production of herbal supplements, as well as biocomplexity of plant-plant and plant-fungal associations.

While preterm infants almost universally receive early and often repeated and/or prolonged intravenous antibiotic therapy, it remains unclear if and how specific antibiotics alter the developmental progression of the gut microbiota in this population. By analyzing 401 fecal samples from 84 longitudinally-sampled preterm infants, we demonstrate that meropenem, cefotaxime, and ticarcillin-clavulanate significantly reduce species richness during their administration, and significantly enrich or deplete specific bacterial species and antibiotic resistance (AR) genes. In contrast, vancomycin and gentamicin, the antibiotics most commonly administered to preterm infants, have non-uniform effects on species richness. We show this response is predictable with 85% accuracy based on the relative abundance of only two bacterial species and two AR genes before treatment. To more fully investigate the role of the gut-associated resistome in response to specific antibiotics, we performed functional metagenomic selections for resistance to 16 clinically relevant antibiotics from a set of 21 preterm infantsâ€™ gut microbiota. Of the 794 AR genes identified, 79% had not previously been classified as providing any resistance phenotype. Combined with deep shotgun sequencing of all 401 fecal samples, we find that multidrug resistant Escherichia, Klebsiella, and Enterobacter species, which are commonly associated with nosocomial infections, dominate the preterm infant gut microbiota. We show that AR genes that are enriched following specific antibiotic treatments are generally unique to the specific treatment and highly correlated (p<0.001) with the abundance of a single species. The most notable exception includes ticarcillin-clavulanate and ampicillin, both of which enrich a large number of overlapping AR genes, and are highly correlated with Klebsiella pneumoniae species in the preterm infant gut microbiota. In addition to AR genes relevant to specific antibiotics likely providing a protective function, we show that all antibiotic treatments also result in widespread collateral microbiome impact through enrichment of AR genes with no known direct activity against the specific antibiotic treatment.

ERP012929	Towards personalized nutrition by prediction of glycemic responses	Elevated postprandial blood glucose levels constitute a global epidemic and a major risk factor for prediabetes and type-II diabetes, but existing dietary methods for controlling them have limited efficacy. Here, we continuously monitored week-long glucose levels in a 800-person cohort, measured responses to 46,898 meals, and found high variability in the response to identical meals, suggesting that universal dietary recommendations may have limited utility. We devised a machine-learning algorithm that integrates blood parameters, dietary habits, anthropometrics, physical activity, and gut microbiota measured in this cohort and showed that it accurately predicts personalized postprandial glycemic response to real-life meals. We validated these predictions in an independent 100-person cohort. Finally, a blinded randomized controlled dietary intervention based on this algorithm resulted in significantly lower postprandial responses and consistent alterations to gut microbiota configuration.

The potential of the native bacterial communities to withstand and attenuate potential accidental spills of petroleum hydrocarbons within this pristine and fragile environment is unknown. As a first step toward increasing this understanding, bacterial communities in melt water from the bottom layer of sea ice cores (sea ice bottom) and surface water from 23 locations around Cornwallis Island, NU, Canada were scrutinized for their hydrocarbon degradation capacity.

ERP016813	Integrated metabolomics and metagenomics analysis of plasma and urine identified microbial metabolites associated with coronary heart disease	Coronary heart disease (CHD) is top risk factor for health in modern society, causing high mortality rate each year. However, there is no reliable way for early diagnosis and prevention of CHD so far. So study the mechanism of CHD and development of novel biomarkers is urgently needed. In this study, metabolomics and metagenomics technology are applied to discover new biomarkers from plasma and urine of 59 CHD patients and 43 healthy controls and trace their origin. We identify GlcNAc-6-P which has good diagnostic capability and can be used as potential biomarkers for CHD, together with mannitol and 15 plasma cholines. These identified metabolites show significant correlations with clinical biochemical indexes. Meanwhile, GlcNAc-6-P and mannitol are potential metabolites originated from intestinal microbiota. Association analysis on species and function levels between intestinal microbes and metabolites suggest a close correlation between Clostridium sp. HGF2 and GlcNAc-6-P, Clostridium sp. HGF2, Streptococcus sp. M143, Streptococcus sp. M334 and mannitol. These suggest the metabolic abnormality is significant and gut microbiota dysbiosis happens in CHD patients.

ERP010892	Compositional_changes_in_the_human_gut_microbiota_driven_by_different_dietary_fibres_are_species_specific	The gut microbiota is influenced by dietary intake. To gain a better understanding of the factors involved, we supplied alternative dietary fibres as energy sources to three different human gut microbial communities in pH-controlled continuous flow fermentors. The communities enriched by apple pectin and inulin did not differ greatly at the phylum and family level, but were strikingly different at the species level. Of the eight most abundant Bacteroides species detected, for example, two were promoted specifically by inulin and six specifically by pectin.

ERP017367	Niche partitioning of diverse sulfur oxidizing bacteria at hydrothermal vents	In the dark ocean primary production is carried out by chemolithoautotrophic microorganisms, with the oxidation of reduced sulfur compounds being a major driver for microbial carbon fixation. At highly sulfidic hydrothermal fields a variety of microorganisms oxidizing sulfur compounds can be observed in high abundance. Yet, the principles of niche differentiation and distribution of the different sulfur-oxidizing prokaryotes (SOP) across geochemical gradients remain poorly understood.We addressed niche differentiation of SOP by extensive sampling of active sulfidic vents at six different hydrothermal venting sites in the Manus Basin, in Papua New Guinea. For this study, we collected 33 diffuse fluid and rising plume samples, and 23 samples from surfaces of chimneys, rocks and fauna. Based on our detailed analyses of 16S RNA gene sequences, metagenomes and real-time in situ measured geochemical parameters, we are now able to describe the distribution and potential niches of SOP from the highly diverse Epsilonproteobacteria genera Sulfurimonas and Sulfurovum and the rather uniform SUP05-clade Gammaproteobacteria within the geochemical mixing gradient. While Sulfurovum was mainly found attached to surfaces exposed to diffuse venting, the SUP05-clade was found to be planktonic in areas of high dilution of the vent fluids by entrained seawater. We further propose that the high diversity within Sulfurimonas and Sulfurovum related bacteria observed in this study derives from the high variation of environmental parameters such as sulfide concentrations across small spatial and temporal scales within their niche.

SRP073479	marine metagenome Metagenome	Marine plastic debris has become a significant concern in ocean ecosystems worldwide. Little is known however, about its influence on microbial community structure and function. In 2008, we surveyed microbial communities and metabolic activities in seawater and on plastic on an oceanographic expedition through the â€˜Great Pacific garbage patchâ€™. The concentration of plastic particles in surface seawater within different size classes (2-5 mm and > 5 mm) ranged from 0.35-3.7 particles m-3 across sampling stations. These densities and the particle size distribution were consistent with previous values reported in the North Pacific Ocean. Net community oxygen production (NCP = gross primary production â€“ community respiration) on plastic debris was positive and so net autotrophic, whereas NCP in bulk seawater was close to zero. Scanning electron microscopy and metagenomic sequencing of plastic-attached communities revealed the dominance of a few metazoan taxa, and a diverse assemblage of photoautotrophic and heterotrophic protists and bacteria. Bryozoa, Cyanobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria and Bacteroidetes dominated all plastic particles, regardless of particle size. Bacteria inhabiting plastic were taxonomically distinct from surrounding picoplankton, and appeared well adapted to a surface-associated lifestyle. Genes with significantly higher abundances among plastic-attached bacteria included che genes, secretion system genes and nifH genes, suggesting enrichment for chemotaxis, frequent cell-to-cell interactions and nitrogen fixation. In aggregate, our findings suggest that plastic debris forms a habitat for complex microbial assemblages that have lifestyles, metabolic pathways and biogeochemical activities that are distinct from free-living planktonic microbial communities.

SRP000664	Taxonomy of Windshield Splatter: Contrasting Geographic Locations using Short Read Counts	How many species inhabit our immediate surrounding?  A straightforward collection technique suitable for answering this question is known to anyone who has ever driven a car at highway speeds.  The windshield of a moving vehicle is subjected to numerous insect strikes and can be used as a collection device for representative sampling. Combined with next-generation sequencing this approach allows for species identification.  Here we describe an application of this methodology to two geographic locations within the Northeastern United States.  We identified 61 arthropod and 39 plant species, seven of which showed significant difference in the relative abundance between the two localities.  Importantly, we developed a novel robust computational framework for the comparison of relative species abundances between geographic locations, which can be used in other read-count-based applications of next-generation sequencing, such as comparison of expression levels.

SRP012480	Unique nucleocytoplasmic dsDNA and +ssRNA viruses are associated with the dinoflagellate endosymbionts of corals	The residence of dinoflagellate algae (genus: Symbiodinium) within scleractinian corals is critical to the construction and persistence of tropical reefs. In recent decades, however, acute and chronic environmental stressors increasingly destabilize this symbiosis, ultimately leading to coral mortality and reef decline. Viral infection has been suggested as a trigger of coral-Symbiodinium dissociation; knowledge of the diversity and hosts of coral-associated viruses is critical to evaluating this hypothesis. Here, we present the first genomic evidence of viruses associated with Symbiodinium, based on the presence of transcribed +ssRNA and dsDNA virus-like genes in cDNA viromes of the coral Montastraea cavernosa and EST libraries generated from Symbiodinium cultures. The M. cavernosa viromes contained divergent viral sequences similar to the major capsid protein of the dinoflagellate-infecting +ssRNA Heterocapsa circularisquama virus (HcRNAV), suggesting a highly novel dinornavirus could infect Symbiodinium. Further, similarities to dsDNA viruses dominated (~69%) eukaryotic viral similarities in the M. cavernosa viromes. Transcripts highly similar to eukaryotic algae-infecting phycodnaviruses were identified in the viromes, and homologs to these sequences were found in two independently generated Symbiodinium EST libraries. Phylogenetic reconstructions substantiate that these transcripts are undescribed and distinct members of the nucleocytoplasmic large DNA virus (NCLDVs) group. Based on a preponderance of evidence, we infer that the novel NCLDVs and RNA virus described here are associated with the algal endosymbionts of corals. If such viruses disrupt Symbiodinium, they are likely to impact the flexibility and/or stability of coral-algal symbioses, and thus long term reef health and resilience.	SRR493106,SRR493108

SRP064713	Functional analysis of the archaea, bacteria, and viruses from a halite endolithic microbial community	Halite endoliths (salt rocks) in the Atacama Desert represent one of the most extreme environments on Earth. We obtained a 9.6 Gb high quality shotgun metagenome from halite nodules collected in the Salar Grande area. Our metagenome is unique because it has high sequencing depth, low diversity, and representative members from all 3 domains of life and from viruses. Taxonomic assignment of the metagenomic reads confirmed that the community is dominated by members of the Archaea, including Nanohaloarchaea, and also comprised members of the Bacteria and Eukarya. The functional annotation of the metagenome revealed that the cyanobacterium Halothece might be responsible for most of the CO2 fixed in the community and that a number of archaea and bacteria could carry out photoheterotrophy, via light-driven proton pumps, increasing the energy budget of the community from light. Our analysis predicted that the alga identified in the community has one of the lowest protein isoelectric point (pI) distributions of any reported eukaryote. Its pI profile was similar to that of halophiles using a â€œsalt-inâ€ strategy. Our genome assembly produced a nanohaloarchaeon genome of 1.2 Mbp with Candidatus Haloredivivus as the closest known reference. We have named this new microorganism Candidatus Nanopetramus SG9. Analysis of its genome sequence revealed a photoheterotrophic life style, a low median isoelectric point for all its predicted proteins, suggesting a â€œsalt-inâ€ strategist, and the presence of a unique CRISPR/Cas system in its genome; one of the spacers from this unique CRISPR/Cas system matched a partial viral genome from the metagenome. We developed new methods to identify viral genomic content from metagenome data, resulting in the identification of over 30 complete or near complete viral or proviral genomes in the halite metagenome. These viral genomes were diverse in genome structure, gene content, host, and genome size. Putative hosts for these viruses included Halobacteriaceae, Nanohaloarchaea, and Cyanobacteria. Despite the dependence on deliquescence of the halite community for liquid water availability, this study revealed an ecosystem spanning three phylogenetic domains, containing a large diversity of viruses, and a predominant â€œsalt-inâ€ strategy to balance the high osmotic pressure of the environment.

ERP010858	Growth dynamics of gut microbiota in health and disease inferred from single metagenomic samples	Metagenomic sequencing has revolutionized our understanding of the role of the microbiome in health and disease, yet it only provides a snapshot of a highly dynamic ecosystem. Here, we show that the pattern of metagenomic sequencing read coverage for different bacterial microbial genomes contains a single trough and a single peak, thate latter coincidinges with  the bacterial origin of replication. Furthermore, the ratio of sequencing coverage between the peak and trough provides a quantitative measure of a speciesâ€™ growth rate. We demonstrate this in vitro and in vivo, under different growth conditions and in complex bacterial communities. For several bacterial species, peak to trough coverage ratios, but not relative abundances, correlated with the manifestation of inflammatory bowel disease and type II diabetes	ERR969462,ERR969464,ERR969465,ERR969466,ERR969467,ERR969468,ERR969469,ERR969470,ERR969471,ERR969472,ERR969473,ERR969474,ERR969475,ERR969476,ERR969477,ERR969478,ERR969479,ERR969480,ERR969481,ERR969482,ERR969483,ERR969484,ERR969485,ERR969486,ERR969487,ERR969488,ERR969489,ERR969490,ERR969491,ERR969492,ERR969493,ERR969494,ERR969495,ERR969496,ERR969497,ERR969499,ERR969500,ERR969501,ERR969502,ERR969503,ERR969504,ERR969505,ERR969506,ERR969507,ERR969510,ERR969511,ERR969512,ERR969513,ERR969514,ERR969515,ERR969516,ERR969517,ERR969518,ERR969519,ERR969520,ERR969521

Here we show that co-occurring diatoms in Narragansett Bay have apparent differences in their metabolic capacity for N and P. Further, bioinformatic approaches enabled the identification and species-specific comparison of resource-responsive genes. Variation of these resource-responsive gene sets highlights the disparate transcriptional responses these species have to the same environment, which likely reflects the role resource partitioning has in facilitating the vast diversity of the phytoplankton.

ERP024243	16S data - Multi-omics Differentially Classify Disease State and Treatment Outcome in Pediatric Crohnâ€™s Disease	Crohnâ€™s disease (CD) has an unclear etiology, but there is growing evidence of a direct link with a dysbiotic microbiome. Many gut microbes have previously been associated with CD, but these have mainly been confounded with patientsâ€™ ongoing treatments. Additionally, most analyses of CD patientsâ€™ microbiomes have focused on microbes in stool samples, which yield different insights than profiling biopsy samples. We sequenced the 16S rRNA gene (16S) and carried out shotgun metagenomics (MGS) from the intestinal biopsies of 20 treatment-naÃ¯ve CD and 20 control pediatric patients. We identified the abundances of microbial taxa and inferred functional categories within each dataset. We also identified known human genetic variants from the MGS data. We then used a machine learning approach to determine the classification accuracy when these datasets, collapsed to different hierarchical groupings, were used independently to classify patients by disease state and by CD patientsâ€™ response to treatment. We found that only 16S-identified microbes could classify patients by disease state, but that both sequencing technologies could classify patients by treatment response. Based on follow-ups with these patients we identified which microbes were best for predicting disease state and response to treatment, including several previously identified markers. By combining the top features from all significant models into a single model, we could compare the relative importance of these predictive features. We validated these top features with an independent cohort to demonstrate that they are general predictors of CD state. We demonstrate for the first time that useful predictors of CD treatment response can be produced from shotgun MGS sequencing of biopsy samples despite the complications related to large proportions of host DNA. The top predictive features that we identified in this study could be useful for building an improved classifier for CD and treatment response based on sufferersâ€™ microbiome in the future.

SRP083280	ice metagenome Metagenome	Liquid water has been known to occur beneath the Antarctic ice sheet for more than 40 years, but only recently have these subglacial aqueous environments been recognized as microbial ecosystems that may influence biogeochemical transformations on a global scale. Here we present the first geomicrobiological description of water and surficial sediments obtained from direct sampling of a subglacial Antarctic lake. Subglacial Lake Whillans (SLW)lies beneath approximately 800m of ice on the lower portion of the Whillans Ice Stream (WIS) in West Antarctica and is part of an extensive and evolving subglacial drainage network. The water column of SLW contained metabolically active microorganisms and was derived primarily from glacial ice melt with solute sources from lithogenic weathering and a minor seawater component. Heterotrophic and autotrophic production data together with small subunit ribosomal RNA gene sequencing and biogeochemical data indicate that SLW is a chemosynthetically driven ecosystem inhabited by a diverse assemblage of bacteria and archaea. Our results confirm that aquatic environments beneath the Antarctic ice sheet support viable microbial ecosystems, corroborating previous reports suggesting that they contain globally relevant pools of carbon and microbes that can mobilize elements from the lithosphere and influence Southern Ocean geochemical and biological systems.

SRP004875	Metagenome isolated from cow gut	The paucity of enzymes that efficiently deconstruct plant polysaccharides represents a major bottleneck for industrial-scale conversion of cellulosic biomass into biofuels. Cow rumen microbes specialize in degradation of cellulosic plant material, but most members of this complex community resist cultivation.  To characterize biomass-degrading genes and genomes, we sequenced and analyzed metagenomic DNA from microbes adherent to plant fiber incubated in cow rumen. From these data, we identified putative carbohydrate-active genes and expressed candidate proteins, of which 57% were enzymatically active against cellulosic substrates. We also assembled 15 uncultured microbial genomes, which were validated by complementary methods including single-cell genome sequencing. These data sets provide a substantially expanded catalog of genes and genomes participating in the deconstruction of cellulosic biomass.

SRP118008	Effects of peri-natal antibiotic administration in piglets on gut microbiota composition and antibiotic resistance gene prevalence Raw sequence reads	The swine gastrointestinal microbiota is comprised of a diverse and complex microbial population that coexists in a coordinated, complex mucosal ecosystem that contributes to host gastrointestinal and immunological development. It is important to understand how common management practices, such as antimicrobial administration, might affect this complex ecosystem and ultimately animal health. In addition, the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria is an urgent public health issue creating pressure to reduce the use of antimicrobials. While the antibiotic resistance profiles of pathogens and opportunistic bacteria cultured from swine have been characterized, the Antimicrobial Resistance Genes (ARG) from the whole gut microbiota have received far less attention. Optimizing the use of antimicrobials in health management programs will require understanding antimicrobial-induced changes to both the gut microbiota and the prevalence of ARG. The objective of this work was to understand the impact of peri-natal antimicrobials on growth, mortality, fecal microbiota composition and abundance of antibiotic resistance genes using Illumina high throughput sequencing	SRR6116340,SRR6116343

ERP010627	Simultaneous deletion of the methylcytosine oxidases Tet1 and Tet3 increases transcriptome variability in early embryogenesis	Dioxygenases of the TET (Ten-Eleven Translocation) family produce oxidized methylcytosines, intermediates in DNA demethylation, as well as new epigenetic marks. Here we show data suggesting that TET proteins maintain the consistency of gene transcription. Embryos lacking Tet1 and Tet3 (Tet1/3 DKO) displayed a strong loss of 5- hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) and a concurrent increase in 5-meth- ylcytosine (5mC) at the eight-cell stage. Single cells from eight-cell embryos and individual embryonic day 3.5 blastocysts showed un- expectedly variable gene expression compared with controls, and this variability correlated in blastocysts with variably increased 5mC/5hmC in gene bodies and repetitive elements. Despite the var- iability, genes encoding regulators of cholesterol biosynthesis were reproducibly down-regulated in Tet1/3 DKO blastocysts, resulting in a characteristic phenotype of holoprosencephaly in the few embryos that survived to later stages. Thus, TET enzymes and DNA cytosine modifications could directly or indirectly modulate transcriptional noise, resulting in the selective susceptibility of certain intracellular pathways to regulation by TET proteins.

ERP004475	Targeted population genomics of marine Synechococcus cyanobacteria	Large-scale sequencing of nucleic acids extracted from diverse sources is now widely used to study the structure and function of bacterial communities. However, the biological complexity of natural environments, combined with both technical and practical difficulties in analysing large datasets often means the full potential of this technique is rarely achieved. In this respect, we present a targeted metagenomic pipeline, focusing on extracting one component of a complex bacterial community. We used a 3 step process: flow cytometric sorting, followed by direct whole genome amplification on purified cells, then high throughput sequencing. We selected Synechococcus, a ubiquitous marine picophytoplankton, as a target and tested our methods on defined mixtures of cultivated isolates before applying the approach on environmental samples. We show that this targeted approach can provide precise and in-depth assessment of the genomic potential of a selected group where low environmental abundance would limit the return of metagenomic information from community-wide DNA surveys. This approach will help to explore fine-scale population structure and biogeography in a genomic context and therefore the underlying mechanisms that allow specific keystone populations, e.g., marine Synechococcus, to cohabit and contribute to nutrient cycling across a range of habitats.

SRP058431	Wetland soil Raw sequence reads	Underground injection of CO2 is a frequently discussed option to translocate anthropogenic CO2 emissions, but the environmental consequences of leakages are poorly understood. As a natural analogue, we studied a floodplain wetland area where localized long-term emanations of cold volcanic CO2 (mofettes) altered soil formation and led to stable hypoxia, as well as increased soil C storage (up to 47.3 w.-% C). We hypothesized that CO2 degassing is associated with functional changes in the mofette soil biome, resulting in increased C input and/or impeded mineralization. With a multi-pronged approach, involving depth-resolved C isotope geochemistry, soil activity, metatranscriptome and metagenome analysis, we identified significant differences in mofette C and energy flow compared to an unaffected floodplain wetland soil.

ERP001842	Extended-spectrum b-lactamase resistance carriage effect on gut microbiota                 in an isolated Amerindian population	The increase of multi-resistant bacteria is a major medical issue. Many                 of the problems associated to antibiotic resistance depend on the spread among                 natural human intestinal populations of particular â€œhigh-riskâ€ bacteria able to                 recruit genetic elements encoding antibiotic resistance, and possibly with high                 host-to-host transmission rates. In order to study the acquisition and spread of                 antibiotic resistance in an isolated population, we studied an Amerindian population                 located in a small village in the Amazon rain-forest (French Guyana) where the                 unique source of antibiotics is the dispensary of the village. We have tested the                 fecal samples from 150 individuals, representing 70% of the population, for the                 presence of Enterobacteria resistant to third generation cephalosporin, where we                 found that 8 individuals have acquired the resistance in a period of 4 years. In                 order to determine the possible origin of the resistances as well as the effect on                 the intestinal microbiota, we have studied the total and active microbiota in those                 eight individuals as well as in never-colonized controls, both close relatives                 living in the same hut and from other families. The main conclusion is that the                 microbiota composition is rather uniform in all the individuals analyzed, probably                 reflecting a similar fiber-rich diet regime. However, a specific effect of the                 resistance genes on the active bacteria cannot be ruled out.	ERR174192,ERR174203,ERR174218

SRP056251	Deep subsurface microbial communities from Mt. Terri, Switzerland - Autotrophic microbial communities BRH/17 Metagenome	The subsurface biosphere is often cited to harbor vast microbial diversity and to represent a significant contribution to the planetâ€™s biomass. There is little understanding of the metabolic processes fueling these communities and the role of lithoautotrophic growth in nutrient cycling in the subsurface. H2 from geogenic sources such as serpentinization, radiolysis of water or hydrothermal fluid circulation is proposed as a fuel for microbial metabolism in deep subsurface environments where light dependent processes are limited to residual sedimentary carbon. The aim of this project is to identify the metabolic processes supported by H2 and characterize the lithoautotrophic microorganisms in the associated microbial community and to characterize the rate of consumption of H2 in these environments to account for microbial H2 consumption in their repository safety assessment models. To pursue these aims, we have built an underground in situ reactor that is delivering H2 to a borehole in the rock located at the Mt. Terri Underground Rock Laboratory in Switzerland that is instrumented to collect information continuously.We have been monitoring sulfate, sulfide, Fe(II), H2, CH4, organic acids, major cations and anions, alkalinity, borehole pressure as well as collecting samples for metagenomic analysis and for isotopic characterization (S, H and C).

The influence of generation time on the dominance of either denitrification or DNRA were studied by altering the culture retention time (and thus generation time) in the bioreactor. Samples for DNA and RNA extraction were taken at different time points (between day 6 and day 336 of cultivation). On day 352 and 365, samples were taken to inoculate two new bioreactors, one of them (transfer I) run with a short generation time, the other one (transfer II) with nitrite as electron acceptor and a long generation time. Whole DNA shotgun metagenomes were sequenced and the reads were assembled into contigs. Enriched total mRNA was used for transcriptome sequencing.

SRP015994	Forestomach fluid Metagenome	Rumen microorganisms play an important role in ruminant digestion and absorption of nutrients and have great potential applications in the field of rumen adjusting, food fermentation and biomass utilization etc. In order to investigate the composition of microorganisms in the rumen of camel (Camelus dromedaries), this study delves in the microbial diversity by culture-independent approach.The present study provides a baseline for understanding the complexity of camel rumen microbial ecology while also highlighting striking similarities and differences when compared to other animal gastrointestinal environments.   A herd of camels, maintained under intensive system of management, were fed daily with Guar pods (Cyamopsis tetragonoloba) husk and Groundnut (Arachis hypogea) haulms. The rumen fluid samples were collected from 6 camels (under mild sedation) using rumen fluid extraction unit designed for camels. The first 100 to 200 ml sample of rumen contents per animal was discarded to limit contamination with saliva. Approximately 50 ml of rumen contents from the second sample was filtered through four layers of autoclaved gauze, and the resulting rumen fluid was immediately placed on ice and was stored at -80Â°C till further DNA extraction. All the animals were clinically normal and in sound health during and after the experiment.	SRR579541,SRR606389

SRP002817	Instability of the rumen microbiota in pre-ruminant calves	The temporal sequence of microbial establishment in the pre-ruminant rumen has important ecological and pathophysiological implications. In this study, we characterized the rumen microbiota of pre-ruminant calves fed milk replacer using metagenomic tools. Contrast to a relatively stable microbiota of 42-day-old calves, the microbial communities of 14-day-old calves displayed a large variation in phylogenetic composition. The sequences from greater than 24 prokaryotic phyla and 22 eukaryotic phyla were identified in microbial communities of pre-ruminant calves. Bacteroidetes was the most dominant phylum in the rumen microbiota of 42-day-old calves, represented by up to 80% of the total sequences, followed by Proteobacteria and Firmicutes. However, the phylum-level composition of the rumen microbiota of 14-day-old calves was distinctly different from that of older pre-ruminant calves as well as that of post-weaning cattle. A total of 441 prokaryotic genera, including 217 genera that existed in all samples tested, were identified. The functional diversity of the rumen microbiota was reflected by a sum of 8,298 Pfam protein families identified. One of the most salient features of the rumen microbiota of pre-ruminant calves was its instability during early rumen development. Some protein families, including peptidases and glycoside hydrolases, were more abundant in the rumen microbial ecosystem of older pre-ruminant calves. It appeared that microbial establishment in the pre-ruminant calves preceded the development of ruminal papillae. Our results provided insight into understanding dynamics of the rumen microbiota and facilitated our efforts in the formulation of optimal early-weaning strategies.

SRP026232	Effects of Diet on Resource Utilization by a Model Human Gut Microbiota Containing Bacteroides cellulosilyticus WH2, a Symbiont with an Extensive Glycobiome (COPRO-Seq)	The human gut microbiota is an important metabolic organ, yet little is known about how its individual species interact, establish dominant positions, and respond to changes in environmental factors such as diet. In this study, gnotobiotic mice were colonized with an artificial microbiota comprising 12 sequenced human gut bacterial species and fed oscillating diets of disparate composition. Rapid, reproducible, and reversible changes in the structure of this assemblage were observed. Time-series microbial RNA-Seq analyses revealed staggered functional responses to diet shifts throughout the assemblage that were heavily focused on carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism. High-resolution shotgun metaproteomics confirmed many of these responses at a protein level. One member, Bacteroides cellulosilyticus WH2, proved exceptionally fit regardless of diet. Its genome encoded more carbohydrate active enzymes than any previously sequenced member of the Bacteroidetes. Transcriptional profiling indicated that B. cellulosilyticus WH2 is an adaptive forager that tailors its versatile carbohydrate utilization strategy to available dietary polysaccharides, with a strong emphasis on plant-derived xylans abundant in dietary staples like cereal grains. Two highly expressed, diet-specific polysaccharide utilization loci (PULs) in B. cellulosilyticus WH2 were identified, one with characteristics of xylan utilization systems. Introduction of a B. cellulosilyticus WH2 library comprising >90,000 isogenic transposon mutants into gnotobiotic mice, along with the other artificial community members, confirmed that these loci represent critical diet-specific fitness determinants. Carbohydrates that trigger dramatic increases in expression of these two loci and many of the organismâ€™s 111 other predicted PULs were identified by RNA-Seq during in vitro growth on 31 distinct carbohydrate substrates, allowing us to better interpret in vivo RNA-Seq and proteomics data. These results offer insight into how gut microbes adapt to dietary perturbations at both a community level and from the perspective of a well-adapted symbiont with exceptional saccharolytic capabilities, and illustrate the value of artificial communities. Overall design: 611 samples total (221 from experiment 1, 390 from experiment 2). Evaluation of changes in an artificial gut community''s structure over time as a result of dietary oscillation.

ERP016191	Metagenome of "hand-picked" Achromatium cells from Lake Stechlin, NE, Germany	Polyploid bacteria are more common than previously believed; however, little is known about the genetic and functional diversity incurred by having multiple chromosomes. We show, using the largest known freshwater bacterium, Achomatium sp., that single cells can host a genetic diversity equal to that of entire populations. No correlation was found between genetic diversity and functional role.  The cells contain an excessive number of transposable elements and we hypothesize that these are involved in, intracellular, inter- and intra-chromosome gene re-arrangements; however, the integrity of operons is maintained. We further hypothesize that gene convergence is strongly reduced in these cells as suggested by the high diversity of the usually conserved 16S rRNA gene. Imaging the 16S rRNA distribution inside the cells points to the potentially spatial-differential expression of genes. Thus, intracellular gene transfer (iGT) leads to a large genetic diversity and potentially accelerated evolution. Polyploidy, multiple alleles, and localized gene expression, suggests Achromatium (and perhaps other polyploid bacteria) uses a genetic machinery similar to multicellular eukaryotes.	ERR1474613
SRP071229	Gymnogyps californianus microbiome raw sequence reads	Detrimental impacts of human activity on biodiversity and ecosystem health have been measured in a variety of ways, yet we are still in dire need of more directly informative signatures which can be used not only to follow broad trends, but to rapidly inform return on investments in mitigative efforts.We present data evaluating the suitability of genomic sequencing of California condor microbiomes to provide indicators of both condor and ecosystem health. Both 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) and shotgun metagenomic DNA sequences were acquired. Numerous species have been previously observed to be associated with birds and microbiomes. These species include opportunistic pathogens and their near-neighbors, probiotics, and environmental microbes. Detailed classification of shotgun DNA sequence data with the Sequedex analysis package provided both phylogenetic and functional profiles of all samples. Phylogenetic classification using reads from phylogenetic marker genes was consistent with (but more specific than) analysis based on 16S data. Classification of samples based on the profile of SEED subsystems indicated three distinct types of samples: fecal, mature cloacal, and immature cloacal. Statistical analysis of the determinants of sample classification indicated niche determinants in metabolism, short-chain fatty acid production, virulence, and stress response pathways. This analysis was further supported by the recovery of protein sequence of niche-specific proteins.

ERP023579	Shotgun metagenomic data of fecal microbiota of patients with H. pylori infection before and after eradication therapy	Helicobacter pylori was reported to be one of the most common reasons of gastric diseases. According to the Maastricht V Consensus, patients with H. pylori infection are prescribed a two-week eradication therapy consisted of 2 types of broad spectrum antibiotics. Such treatment can negatively affect the gut microbiota of patients by decreasing the number of members of the normal bacterial flora. The metagenomic analisys of the fecal microbiota of patients with H. pylori infection at 3 time points (before the start of the eradication therapy, immediately after the therapy and several weeks after the end of treatment) could help to reveal the taxonomic and functional changes in intestinal microflora and to detect molecular markers of gastrointestinal diseases pathogenesis.

ERP014306	Shotgun metagenomics of moose rumen	The moose (Alces alces) manages to utilize energy from fiber-rich lignocellulose material through enzymes produced by the microbes in its rumen. Some of these specialized enzymes may outperform cellulases and hemicellulases that are used in bio-refinery processes today. Shotgun metagenomics offers a method to study microbial communities in detail and to capture the gene sequences coding for enzymes that can be produced in the laboratory. We applied the technique on rumen material from moose. Through a binning approach, a large number of metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from single species and strains were isolated and characterized based on taxonomy and carbohydrate active enzyme (CAZY) profile. Most of the 99 MAGs were classified to the bacterial phyla Bacteriodetes and Firmicutes, which is in agreement with previous studies of rumen from moose and other herbivores. Phylogenomic analysis of MAGs revealed novel clades within Bacteriodetes with no related previously characterized genome. In addition, new genomes that were closely related to the recently described Melainabacteria, newly proposed candidate divisions SR1 and TM7 and previously uncharacterized Alphaproteobacteria were also retrieved. Putative cellulolytic  functions were observed in several clades of Bacteroidetes and for MAGs of genus Ruminococcus, Fibrobacteres, and Treponema. Cellulosome components were present in MAGs of Ruminococcus but also in certain clades of Bacteroidetes. Cellulosomes are generally described in the Firmicutes family Clostridiales. Multiple putative cellulases were identified within species from several phyla. At a general level, the most frequently occurring polysaccharide-degrading enzymes targeted hemicellulose, starch and pectin. This study describes the first shotgun-metagenomic characterization of moose rumen and the high number of reconstructed genomes provides a valuable link between phylogeny and cellulolytic role.

Increased levels of ruminal propionate have been shown to improve overall bovine metabolic efficiency.  However, the response to propionate by ruminal microbes that affects this change remains poorly characterized.  The rumen microbiota and its response to sodium propionate intake was studied using metagenomics.  Genomic DNA was harvested from two rumens, one control sample and a treatment sample (propionate-administered) and sequence data was produced using an Illumina Genome Analyzer instrument. Understanding the bovine rumen microbiota has important implications for animal agriculture.   The SRA data is available using the Projects link.	SRR020795,SRR020796

ERP014129	Investigation of P. acnes levels in NGS data from cancer samples	Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes) is the most abundant bacterium on human skin, particularly in sebaceous areas. P. acnes is suggested to be an opportunistic pathogen involved in the development of diverse medical conditions, but is also a proven contaminant of human samples and surgical wounds. Its significance as a pathogen is consequently a matter of debate. In the present study we investigated the presence of P. acnes DNA in 250 next generation sequencing datasets generated from 180 samples of 20 different sample types, mostly of cancerous origin. The samples were either subjected to microbial enrichment, involving nuclease treatment to reduce the amount of host nucleic acids, or shotgun-sequenced. We detected high proportions of P. acnes in enriched samples, particularly skin derived and other tissue samples, with levels being higher in enriched compared to shotgun-sequenced samples. P. acnes reads were detected in most samples analysed, though the proportions in most shotgun-sequenced samples were low.   Our results show that P. acnes can be detected in practically all sample types when employing molecular methods such as next generation sequencing. The possibility of contamination from the patient or other sources, including laboratory reagents or environment, should therefore always be considered carefully when P. acnes is detected in clinical samples. We advocate that detection of P. acnes is always accompanied by experiments validating the association between this bacterium and any clinical condition.

SRP007242	What controls long-term changes in freshwater microbial community composition?	Microbial ecology came to the forefront of biological and ecological science in the 1990s with the development of high-throughput DNA sequencing and other molecular techniques.  Recently this field entered a second age of understanding that microbial diversity was organized into patterns at various scales, consistent with ecological concepts that were once thought applicable only to macro-organisms.  Evidence of these patterns in diversity contradicts the traditional microbial hypothesis from Bass-Becking (1934) that â€œEverything is everywhere, but the environment selects,â€ and indicates that, as with larger organisms, dispersal processes influence microbial diversity even at regional and local scales.  It is clear that both dispersal and environmental conditions are related to patterns of diversity, but to date the mechanistic controls and the relative importance of these factors have not been determined.  This study aims to resolve these controls through a combination of field and lab experiments with monitoring and surveys of the phylogenetic composition and ecosystem function (metabolism) of microbial communities.  This research builds on a long-term record showing consistent spatial and temporal patterns of microbial growth and community composition in ~25 lakes and streams of the Toolik Lake Research Area in Arctic Alaska.  Using experiments coupled with established sampling protocols and routines, this research will answer 3 basic questions, and focus on the long-term aspects of dispersal events and climate change: (1) How does environment influence microbial community composition and rate of function? (2) How are distribution patterns of microbial communities in lakes, streams, and soils influenced by dispersal via down-slope water flow? (3) How are seasonal, inter-annual, and long-term shifts in microbial community composition related to temporal shifts in environmental conditions such as those caused by climate change?  Long-term investigations of microbial communities are critical for understanding patterns of diversity and their controls, especially because the most enduring dispersal events are also most rare.  Moreover, because this work is located in the Arctic it will capture the earliest biological effects of global climate change.	SRR305966,SRR305967

ERP007115	Metagenomic approach to examine respiratory samples from children with upper respiratory tract infections	Viruses are the most frequent cause of respiratory disease in children. However, despite the advanced diagnostic methods currently in use, in 20 to 50% of respiratory samples a specific pathogen cannot be detected. This observation has led investigators to wonder if novel respiratory viruses are still to be discovered. In this work, we used a metagenomic approach to examine respiratory samples from children with upper respiratory tract infections that had been previously found negative for 6 bacteria and 15 respiratory viruses by PCR. Nasopharyngeal swabs from 46 outpatient children (out of 526) from five different cities of the state of Veracruz, Mexico were studied. All the samples were pooled into 25 DNA libraries for sequencing. DNA reads for at least one virus commonly associated to respiratory infections was found in 22 of the 25 sequenced libraries, while in all other, but one, pathogenic bacteria were detected. Reads for respiratory syncytial virus, coronavirus-OC43, and rhinovirus were identified. In addition, viruses less frequently associated to respiratory infections were also found as saffold, anellovirus, rotavirus, and astrovirus, as well as several animal and plant viruses. No novel viruses were identified.	ERR651259,ERR651260,ERR651262,ERR651265,ERR651271,ERR651273,ERR651274,ERR651275

ERP012016	We employed shotgun metagenome and 16S rDNA gene amplicon sequencing of topsoil samples to robustly compare the taxonomic and functional gene content variability of microbial soil communities between two key soil ecosystems for climate change, a remote Alaskan tundra (melting) permafrost (AK) and a natural prairie temperate soil in Oklahoma (OK).	How soil microbial communities from different ecosystems contrast with respect to taxonomic and functional composition remains an unresolved question; one that is vital to predict how climate change will affect soil carbon. We employed shotgun metagenome and 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing to characterize community composition and metabolic potential at two distinct ecosystems: Alaskan tundra and natural prairie temperate soil in Oklahoma. The abundance of several metabolic functions differed substantially between the two ecosystems, reflecting mostly the physical characteristics, aboveground plant species composition, and nutrient conditions specific to each site. Correspondingly, the ecosystems shared only a minor fraction of their OTUs (<6%), while Alaska communities were an order of magnitude less diverse their Oklahoma counterparts, allowing near-complete coverage by sequencing (~92% breadth). 27 near-complete, high-quality, population genomes were recovered from the Alaska metagenomes, including an acidobacterial population that comprised 0.77-3.14% of the entire microbial community. These genomes represented diverse taxonomic groups and metabolic lifestyles tuned toward sulfur cycling, methanotrophy, and plant-derived carbon oxidation. Several recovered Alaska populations were also present in geographically distant tundra habitats, suggesting that the assembled populations are also highly relevant at regional or even global scales, and provide potential model organisms for future in-situ experimental manipulations.

SRP042162	Hakon Mosby Mud Volcano Targeted Locus (Loci)	Mud volcanoes are commonly called "windows to the deep biosphere", because they represent surface expressions of a rapid upward transport of subsurface sediments of as deep as a few kilometers. On land and in the sea we know of ten thousands of active mud volcanoes, which expel muds, anoxic fluids, gases and hydrocarbons. First microbiological investigations of submarine mud volcanoes have indicated that the subsurface muds are inhabited by typical subsurface microorganisms (e.g. marine benthic crenarchaeal groups, Cytophaga/Flavobacteria groups), but that they are overgrown by anaerobic and aerobic methanotrophs after exposure to electron acceptors such as sulfate and oxygen. However, the time scales at which this succession occurs, the fate of the original deep biosphere communities and the potential for their dispersal remain unknown. In 2009 and 2010, we had the opportunity to sample transects across very recent mud flows at the Hakon Mosby Mud Volcano (HMMV), including a major flow from a recent eruption. We propose to analyze samples of different sediment depths, spatial and temporal distances from the fresh mud flow for both their bacterial and archaeal communities to improve knowledge on the composition, persistence and dispersal of deep biosphere communities which are exposed to surface environments.

ERP006630	Thermus thermophilus is responsible for the pink discolouration defect in cheese	High-throughput, culture-independent DNA sequencing-based strategies have revolutionised our understanding of the composition of microbial populations, including those in foods. While many are descriptive studies, there are studies linking particular microorganisms with specific desirable/undesirable impacts being revealed. Here we apply such a strategy to study pink discolouration of cheese, a spoilage defect that affects the associated industry worldwide. Despite efforts over many decades, the basis for this phenomenon has remained elusive with traditional approaches having failed to reveal a microbial basis for this problem.  The bacterial composition problematic cheeses were assessed by DNA sequencing. This revealed the presence of bacteria from the genus Thermus, at higher levels in defect, relative to control, cheeses. This observation was particularly notable in light of the fact that, Thermus, which are non-pathogenic, thermophilic bacteria which do not readily grow on the media employed to culture dairy microorganisms, have previously been associated with pink discolouration problems in the paper industry.  Prompted by this finding, a target-specific culture-based approach was employed and Thermus thermophilus was successfully cultured from defect cheeses. Furthermore, qPCR revealed the species to be present at 103 cfu g-1 in the aforementioned defect-containing cheeses but to be absent or present at low levels only (101 cfu g-1) in the equivalent control cheeses. The link between Thermus and the pinking phenomenon was further investigated through the production and analysis of cheeses into which Thermus was spiked and of control cheeses. Crucially, the defect was reconstructed only in test cheeses containing the cheese-derived T. thermophilus.	ERR752910,ERR752911,ERR752912,ERR752913,ERR752914,ERR752915,ERR752916,ERR752918,ERR752919
DRP003048	Metagenomics of Japanese gut microbiomes	The human gut microbiome has profound influences on the hostâ€™s health largely through its inter- ference with various intestinal functions. As recent studies have suggested diversity in the human gut microbiome among human populations, it will be interesting to analyse how gut microbiome is correlated with geographical, cultural, and traditional differences. The Japanese people are known to have several characteristic features such as eating a variety of traditional foods and exhibit- ing a low BMI and long life span. In this study, we analysed gut microbiomes of the Japanese by com- paring the metagenomic data obtained from 106 Japanese individuals with those from 11 other nations. We found that the composition of the Japanese gut microbiome showed more abundant in the phylum Actinobacteria, in particular in the genus Bifidobacterium, than other nations. Regard- ing the microbial functions, those of carbohydrate metabolism were overrepresented with a concur- rent decrease in those for replication and repair, and cell motility. The remarkable low prevalence of genes for methanogenesis with a significant depletion of the archaeon Methanobrevibacter smithii and en- richment of acetogenesis genes in the Japanese gut microbiome compared with others suggested a difference in the hydrogen metabolism pathway in the gut between them. It thus seems that the gut microbiome of the Japanese is considerably different from those of other populations, which cannot be simply explained by diet alone. We postulate possible existence of hitherto unknown factors contributing to the population-level diversity in human gut microbiomes.

From the result of analyzing of sequence datasets, 147 glycoside hydrolase (GH) genes were indentified and classified into 40 GH families, and almost genes showed less than 70% similarity to known enzymes of eukaryota including thermophilic fungi and alveolata. Furthermore, 14 contigs were predicted to be full-length cDNA.

SRP109823	Functional gene diversity and expression in methane-hydrate bearing deep subsurface sediments	Methane is a critical component of the deep subsurface. In shallow marine sediments, anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) is coupled to sulfate reduction. However, relatively little is known about which microbial metabolisms are active in deeply buried sediment containing methane hydrates, particularly with regard to alternative electron acceptors that could fuel deep AOM. We propose to determine which microbial population(s) and functional genes are active in the deep biosphere beneath Hydrate Ridge offshore Oregon by sequencing metagenomes and 16S amplicons from samples drilled on ODP Leg 204 and archived for future molecular analysis. We will analyze gene diversity and expression in six geochemically distinct zones from 2 to 139 meters below the seafloor with the goal of evaluating the relationship between geochemical conditions (i.e. sulfate, iron and manganese availability) and microbial metabolic activity.

Project summary:  Wild bees collectively play a keystone role in the pollination of wild plants and cultivated crops and thereby help to maintain biodiversity and increase food production. Evidence of declines in wild pollinators and insect-pollinated plants requires high-throughput methods to monitor bee abundance and diversity, since the number of wild bee species ranges from hundreds to thousands per country. Morphology-based identification and PCR-based metabarcoding are inefficient because taxonomic expertise is scarce, and the Hymenoptera are recalcitrant to PCR. We have developed a metagenomic approach to identify bee species from bulk samples, and to monitor wild bee diversity and abundance.

ERP003492	Practical innovations for high-throughput amplicon sequencing	Characterizing microbial communities by sequencing rRNA amplicons is a cornerstone of metagenomics. We present cost-saving and accuracy improvements for 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing on the Illumina MiSeq platform, many of which are generalizable to other amplicons and sequencing systems. First, we deploy a mix of frame-shifted primers as an alternative to the common, wasteful practice of re-sequencing 5 to 50% phiX174 genomic DNA to provide diversity at each sequencing cycle. Second, we produce amplicons by uniquely tagging all template molecules, and then amplifying the tagged templates in a PCR step. Consensus sequences built from sequences sharing an identical tag reconstruct the original template population, dramatically minimizing sequencing error and PCR bias. Third, the ability to mix-and-match various template-tagging primers with the same set of universal PCR-plus-barcode primers allows combinatorial barcoding and investigation of multiple amplicons. Last, because rRNA studies often involve characterization of microbial communities in association with their eukaryotic hosts, we deploy PCR clamps to block amplification of contaminating plant plastid and mitochondrial DNA sequences, yielding upwards of five-fold increase in microbial sequences without biasing the plant-associated microbial community. These techniques, in conjunction with the informatics pipeline we provide, improve both the efficiency and accuracy of rRNA amplicon sequencing, and may be deployed independently to suit user needs.

Here we have performed a study on RPW gut microbial flora by applying parallel pyrosequencing using a Roche/454 Genome sequencer FLX Titanium. Totally, four samples had been used to construct shotgun libraries, among which tens of RPW larval individuals were collected on farms in Hofuf, Saudi Arabia in March, July and November (L-3, L-7 and L-11), and adult ones in March and May (A-S) were pooled together as the contrast. Furthermore, amplicon pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA partial fragemnt was used to verify the impact of temperature on gut microbiota (L-HT vs L-LT) and get a snapshot of gut microbiota at different rearing ages in lab (L-M0.5, L-M1, L-M1.5 and L-M2).

ERP015054	Bioprospecting for genes encoding hydrocarbon-degrading enzymes from metagenomic samples isolated from northern Adriatic Sea sediments	Three metagenomic libraries were constructed using surface sediment samples from the northern Adriatic Sea. Two of the samples were taken from a highly polluted and an unpolluted site respectively. The third sample from a polluted site had been selected using crude oil. The results of the metagenome analyses were incorporated in the REDPET relational database (http://redpet.bioinfo.pbf.hr/REDPET), which was generated using the previously developed MEGGASENSE platform. The database includes taxonomic data to allow the assessment of the biodiversity of metagenomic libraries and a general functional analysis of genes using hidden Markov model (HMM) profiles based on the KEGG database. A set of 22 specialised HMM-profiles was developed to detect putative genes for hydrocarbon-degrading enzymes. Use of these profiles showed that the metagenomic library generated after selection on crude oil had enriched genes for aerobic n-alkane degradation. The use of this system for bioprospecting was exemplified using potential alkB and almA genes from this library.	ERR1358764,ERR1358765,ERR1358766

SRP065833	biosolids Metagenome	The use of treated municipal wastewater residues (biosolids) as fertilizers is an attractive, inexpensive option for growers and farmers. Various regulatory bodies typically employ indicator organisms (Fecal coliforms, E. coli and Salmonella) to assess the adequacy and efficiency of the wastewater treatment process in reducing pathogen loads in the final product. Presence of these organisms after the treatment is used as an indicator of potential contamination with pathogenic species. The routine tests currently rely on culture-based methods and thus can only detect viable and cultivable microorganisms. Molecular detection approaches can offer some advantages over culture-based methods as they can simultaneously detect a wider microbial species range, including non-cultivable microorganisms, however, they cannot directly assess the viability of the pathogen. Molecular methods infer the microorganismâ€™s presence though detection of its DNA signature thus indicating that a pathogenic species was present at some point during the wastewater treatment but traditional cultivation methods to confirm its presence in a viable form in the final product is required in order to make any inference as to the productâ€™s risk profile. Here, we used bacterial enumeration methods together with molecular methods including qPCR, 16S rRNA and cpn60 gene amplicon sequencing and shotgun metagenomic sequencing to compare pre- and post-treatment biosolids from two Canadian wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs).

SRP063648	Characterisation of symbiotic cellulolytic microbial consortium enriched on napier grass	Cooperative interactions of bacteria plays an important role on decomposition of complex lignocellulosic plant biomass which provides a basis on carbon cycling in nature and conversion of biomass to fuels and chemicals in biorefineries. In this study, active lignocellulose degrading microbial consortium was constructed from microflora originated from forest compost soil by successive subcultivation on napier grass under facultative anoxic conditions. The structurally stable enriched consortia comprised mainly Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Bacteroidetes according to tagged 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Changes in the microcosm structure was found during batch cultivation of the consortium with increasing abundance of facultative Proteobacteria in the middle of incubation period which was then subsequently replaced by Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes along with dynamic change in CMCase, xylanse, and ÃŸ-glucanase activity profile in the supernatant. The consortium was highly active on degradation of alkaline pretreated lignocellulosic substrates with more than 50% reduction in solid biomass after incubation at 40 oC for 10 d. Direct shotgun sequencing of the MQSc metagenomes revealed an abundance of genes encoding for various lignocellulose degrading enzymes in 23 glycosyl hydrolase (GH) families. Various enzymes attacking the main-chain and side-chain of cellulosic and hemicellulosic were dominated by GH2, 3, 5, 9, 10, 26, 28 and 43, reflecting adaptation of the enzyme systems to the herbaceous substrate. The complex structurally stable consortium is a platform for discovering potential lignocellulose degrading enzymes for biotechnological applications.	SRR2388864,SRR2388866

SRP074327	Synthetic environmental metagenomes for MinION evalutation	Environmental metagenomics is accomplished by annotation of WGS sequences or assignment of taxonomy based on 16S amplicon sequences. Both of these approaches provide species annotations that are limited by read length. A nanopore-based sequencing platform, MinIONâ„¢, produces reads 1e+04 bp and greater, which has the potential to provide for more precise assignment of taxa, thereby alleviating some of the error inherent in determining metagenome composition from short reads. In this study, we tested the ability of sequence data produced by the MinIONâ„¢ nanopore platform to correctly classify prokaryotes in single-species runs (R7.3 flow cells) and in two types of simple mixed synthetic communities: an equimolar mixture of DNA from four species (using R7.3 and Mk1 flow cells) and a community with one relatively rare (1%) component (both R7.3 and Mk1 flow cells). Community analysis was performed by three methods: BLAST, KRACKEN, and MG-RAST.	SRR3473966,SRR3473967,SRR3473968,SRR3473969,SRR3473970,SRR3473971,SRR3473972

ERP004406	Placing environmental next generation sequencing amplicons from microbial eukaryotes into a phylogenetic context	Nucleotide positions in the hyper-variable V4 and V9 regions of the SSU-rDNA locus are normally difficult to align and are removed prior to standard phylogenetic analyses. But with next generation sequencing data, amplicons of these regions are all there is to answer ecological and evolutionary questions that depend on phylogenetic inferences. With ciliates, we asked how inclusion of the V4 or V9 regions, regardless of alignment quality, affects tree topologies using distinct phylogenetic methods (including PairDist that is introduced here). Results show that the best approach is to place V4 amplicons into an alignment of full-length Sanger SSU-rDNA sequences and to infer the phylogenetic tree with RAxML. A sliding window analysis as implemented in RAxML shows, though, that not all nucleotide positions in the V4 region are better than V9 at inferring the ciliate tree. With this approach and an ancestral-state reconstruction, we use V4 amplicons from European near-shore sampling sites to infer that rather than being primarily terrestrial and freshwater, colpodean ciliates may have repeatedly transitioned from terrestrial/freshwater to marine environments.

SRP065223	Human gut microbial metagenomic assembly	Identifying bacterial strains in metagenome and microbiome samples using computational analyses of short-read sequence remains a difficult problem. Here, we present an analysis of a human gut microbiome using Tru-seq synthetic long reads and computational tools for metagenomic long-read assembly, variant-calling and haplotyping (Nanoscope and Lens). Our analysis identifies 178 bacterial species, of which 51 were not found using short sequence reads alone. We recover bacterial contigs that comprise multiple operons, including 22 contigs of >1Mbp. Extensive intraspecies variation among microbial strains in the form of haplotypes that span up to hundreds of Kbp can be observed using our approach. Incorporation of synthetic long-read sequencing technology with standard short-read shotgun sequencing approaches enables more rapid and comprehensive analyses of metagenome and microbiome samples.

SRP014928	Sewage Viruses Metagenome	Analysis of sewage by deep sequencing provides an efficient method for large-scale viral discovery and for monitoring enteric viral infections in large populations. A metagenomics analysis was performed on viral particles purified from untreated sewage collected in the US, Nigeria, Thailand, and Nepal. Sequences related to 29 eukaryotic viral families infecting vertebrates, invertebrates, plants, and prokaryotes were identified (E score < 10-4) including known (>90% protein similarity) viral pathogens infecting human (Adenoviridae, Astroviridae, Caliciviridae, Hepeviridae, Parvoviridae, Picornaviridae, Picobirnaviridae, and Reoviridae), plants (Alphaflexiviridae, Betaflexiviridae, Partitiviridae, Sobemovirus, Secoviridae, Sobemovirus, Tombusviridae, Tymoviridae, Virgaviridae) and insects (Dicistroviridae, Nodaviridae, Densovirinae). The full and partial genomes of a novel kobuvirus, salivirus and sapovirus were described. A novel astrovirus, Casa astrovirus, basal to those infecting mammals and birds, potentially representing a third astrovirus genus, was identified. Multiple potential new genera and families of ssRNA viruses distantly related to members of the picornavirus-like superfamily were genetically characterized that we named Picalivirus, Secalivirus, Hepelivirus, Nedicistrovirus, Cadicistrovirus, and Niflavirus. Phylogenetic analysis placed these highly divergent genomes as diverging near the root of the picornavirus-like superfamily. Nucleotide composition indicated possible plant and arthropod tropisms. Highly divergent circular ssDNA genomes of the plant-infecting Geminiviridae family were identified. Two circular DNA genomes from Baminivirus and Niminivirus could be considered new genera of the plant infecting Geminiviridae. The generation of numerous long sequence assemblies without significant protein similarities to known viruses may reflect the presence of novel viral families. These results highlight the high viral genetic diversity found in a pervasive environmental pollutant and provide genetic information for future studies of these novel viruses.

ERP015807	Early Neolithic genomes from the eastern Fertile Crescent	Farming was first established in the Neolithic core zone of the Fertile Crescent some 10.000 years ago. Core zone populations were believed to be homogeneous, despite being widespread over the Near and Middle East. We sequenced genomes from Early Neolithic individuals in the Zagros region of Iran (eastern Fertile Crescent) which represent a previously uncharacterized population that is neither ancestral to the first European farmers nor has contributed significantly to the ancestry of modern Europeans. We estimate that these people separated from Early Neolithic peoples in Anatolia some 51- 77,000 years ago and show affinities to modern day Pakistani and Afghan peoples but particularly to Iranian Zoroastrians. Thus multiple hunter-gatherer populations likely adopted farming in SW-Asia, with components of pre-Neolithic population structure were preserved as farming spread into neighboring region.

SRP065125	Experimental Evolution of Silver Resistance in Escherichia coli	Silver is highly toxic to bacteria in both ionic and nanoparticle forms. Silver impacts many aspects of bacterial physiology, and so it has been postulated that resistance to it will be difficult to evolve. However, silver resistance has occasionally been reported in nature, and we previously showed the rapid evolution of resistance to silver nanoparticles (AgNP) in Escherichia coli. The results of the present study further indicate that even highly sensitive bacteria can rapidly evolve resistance to ionic silver, suggesting caution with respect to the idea that silver presents a difficult challenge for bacteria to overcome.

ERP016258	By taking three metagenomic approaches to reveal the microplankton communities from composition to functional properties in this study. It should make a significant advance in understanding the impacts of human activities on ecosystem functions, from the angle of dam influences on the microbial functions.	The Three Gorges Dam has significantly altered ecological and environmental conditions within the reservoir region, but how these changes affect bacterioplankton structure and function is unknown. Here, three widely accepted metagenomic tools were employed to study the impact of damming on the bacterioplankton community in the Xiangxi River. Our results indicated that bacterioplankton communities were both taxonomically and functionally different between backwater and riverine sites, which represent communities with and without direct dam effects, respectively. There were many more nitrogen cycling Betaproteobacteria (e.g., Limnohabitans), and a higher abundance of functional genes and KEGG orthology (KO) groups involved in nitrogen cycling in the riverine sites, suggesting a higher level of bacterial activity involved in generating more nitrogenous nutrients for the growth of phytoplankton. Additionally, the KO categories involved in carbon and sulfur metabolism, as well as most of the detected functional genes also showed clear backwater and riverine patterns. As expected, these diversity patterns all significantly correlated with environmental characteristics, confirming that the bacterioplankton communities in the Xiangxi River were really affected by environmental changes from the Three Gorges Dam. This study provides a first comparative metagenomic insight for evaluating the impacts of the large dam on microbial function.	ERR1474558,ERR1474559,ERR1474560,ERR1474561,ERR1474562,ERR1474563

SRP029234	Histone Deacetylase 3 orchestrates commensal bacteria-dependent intestinal homeostasis	The development and severity of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) and other chronic inflammatory conditions can be influenced by host genetic and environmental factors, including signals derived from commensal bacteria1-6.  However, the mechanisms that integrate these diverse cues remain undefined. Here we demonstrate that intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) isolated from IBD patients exhibit decreased expression of the epigenome-modifying enzyme histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3). Further, genome-wide analyses of murine IECs that lack HDAC3 (HDAC3?IEC) revealed that HDAC3 deficiency resulted in dysregulated gene expression coupled with alterations in histone acetylation.  Critically, conventionally-housed HDAC3?IEC mice demonstrated loss of Paneth cells, impaired IEC function and alterations in the composition of intestinal commensal bacteria.  In addition, HDAC3?IEC mice exhibited significantly increased susceptibility to intestinal damage and inflammation, indicating that epithelial expression of HDAC3 plays a central role in maintaining intestinal homeostasis.  Strikingly, rederivation of HDAC3?IEC mice into germ-free conditions revealed that dysregulated IEC gene expression, Paneth cell homeostasis, and intestinal barrier function were largely restored in the absence of commensal bacteria.  Collectively, these data indicate that the HDAC3 is a critical factor that integrates commensal bacteria-derived signals to calibrate epithelial cell responses required to establish normal host-commensal relationships and maintain intestinal homeostasis.

ERP010613	Handley et al. demonstrate that vaccination against SIV infection in Rhesus macaques prevents alterations in the gastrointestinal virome and bacterial microbiome that are typically associated with poor disease outcome.	Pathogenic simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection is associated with AIDS, expansion of the eukaryotic enteric virome, consequent intestinal epithelial damage, translocation of viral and bacterial components into the circulation and systemic immune activation. Here we characterized changes in the enteric virome and bacterial microbiome during pathogenic SIV infection, and determined whether vaccine-mediated protection altered these disease manifestations. Vaccine-associated protection against SIV infection prevented expansion of the enteric virome. Overall gastrointestinal bacterial community structure was indistinguishable in protected and unprotected animals, however, animals that ultimately succumb to AIDS related disease had altered levels of several bacterial taxa including an increased abundance of many disease-associated bacteria. These data suggest that immune control of SIV-induced immunodeficiency aids in the maintenance of a normal fecal microbiome and ameliorates SIV-associated systemic inflammation.

DRP000969	Asian seabass metagenomes in response to different stressors	Uncovering the taxonomic composition and functional capacity within the intestine microbial consortia of fishes under different conditions is of great importance to fish physiology and health. Nonetheless, no detailed information on the functional diversity of the fish intestine metagenomes in response to stress is available. The Asian seabass Lates calcarifer is an important farmed foodfish species, inhabiting coastal waters, estuaries, lagoons and rivers, widely distributed in the Indo-West Pacific region (FishBase: www.fishbase.org). This species feeds on crustaceans, molluscsmollusks, and smaller fish. In our study, we challenged Asian seabass with pathogens, salinity and fast conditions, and sequenced metagenomic DNA isolated from the fish post stressor challenge with the illumina high throughput sequencing technique platform.By using comparative metagenomic studies and analyses of selected gene sets by quantitative PCR, we determined the microbial gene catalogue and investigated the changes of the microbial composition and the host-microbe interactions in response to different stressors in the Asian seabass intestines.

SRP002442	HÃ¥kon Mosby Mud Volcano metagenome	The HÃ¥kon Mosby Mud Volcano is an active methane-driven cold seep located in the Barents Sea. The highly diverse microbial community in the subseafloor sediments of the volcano derives its energy from methane and hydrocarbones found in the emitted volcano fluid. Here, we present the metagenomic analysis of the prokaryotic community found in a HÃ¥kon Mosby Mud Volcano sediment sample. The metagenome was created using 454 pyrosequencing. Analysis of the metagenome indicated a high microbial diversity. Bacteria and Archaea made up 94.6 and 5.4% of the microbial reads, with Proteobacteria and Euryarchaeota being the dominant phyla. The metabolic potential was studied using both the MG-RAST annotation and the KEGG Automatic Annotation Server. Binning of metagenomic reads into taxa such as Proteobacteria, Archaea and Bacteroidetes, allowed annotation of reads and linking of metabolic routes to specific microbial groups. Thus, phylum-specific genes were identified belonging to specific metabolic routes like CO2 fixation, nitrogen cycling, sulfur cycling and methanogenesis or its reversal (anaerobic oxidation of methane). Our approach demonstrates how metagenomic analysis can be used to unravel the metabolic potential of different phyla within the same sample. For instance our analyses showed that many important enzymes in methanogenesis were found only among archaeal sequences in the HÃ¥kon Mosby Mud Volcano metagenome. The method provides a powerful approach to a better understanding of the ecology and relationships within complex microbial communities.	SRR043581,SRR043582

ERP020191	Estimation of variability in the gut microbiota resistome of the Russian citizens aimed at identification of pathways for transmission and spread of antibiotic resistance.	A problem of antibiotic resistance emergence in microbiome will be investigated in the research. To date, gut microbiome (as well as soil microbiome) is considered to be antibiotic resistance reservoir. The resistance can accumulate in the microbiome after antibiotic treatment against infectious agents, and it can be passed to pathogenic bacteria during further infections, even though absence of the target infection is checked after each therapy. Moreover, use of antibiotics in agriculture and every day life (without doctorâ€™s recommendations) creates an environment for antibiotic resistance transfer between microbiomes, as there is always a selective pressure for it. That is a quite dangerous situation, as there is a permanent ubiquitous antibiotic resistance (AR) background. In the framework of the research available data on Russian and worldwide microbiomes (more than 2000 by 2015 year) will be analyzed and groups of patients who passed antibiotic treatment will be studied. Using obtained results a map of antibiotic resistance expansion will be created, dominating mechanisms of the resistance transfer and AR genes hosts will be revealed. Additionally, laboratory methods and mathematical analysis for genesâ€™ and mechanismsâ€™ screening will be developed. The developed models AR transfer will make possible modeling of various methods for AR transfer prevention, or, alternatively, modeling of consequences of different antibioticsâ€™ use. Concluding, basic mechanisms of AR emergence will be described (6-1-3) and new methods of screening will be proposed. Furthermore, principle of the screening operation will be demonstrated on available data on AR, as well as on chosen clinical groups.

ERP014480	Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery of morbidly obese patients shows swift and persistent changes of the individual gut microbiota	Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is an effective means to achieve sustained weight loss for morbidly obese individuals. Besides rapid weight reduction, patients achieve major improvements of insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis. Dysbiosis of gut microbiota has been associated with obesity and some of its co-morbidities like type 2 diabetes, and major changes of gut bacterial communities have been hypothesized to mediate part of the beneficial metabolic effects observed after RYGB. This study we describe changes in gut microbial taxonomic composition and functional potential following RYGB.

ERP005835	Construction of a dairy microbial genome catalog opens new perspectives for the metagenomic analysis of cheese microbiota	Microbial communities of cheeses, in particular traditional ones are very diverse, questioning their origin, safety and functional role in cheese making. Metagenomic analysis of these communities by Very High Throughput Sequencing Technology (VHTST) with short read shotgun sequencing is a promising approach for their microbial profiling and functional study. However, VHTST requires an adequate genome sequence database to assign the short reads.  The objective of the present study was to constitute a reference genome catalogu suitable for short read metagenomic analysis. Bacteria isolated from dairy products, and belonging to 137 different species and 67 genera were selected, including isolates from the genera Alkalibacterium, Brochotrix, Kluyvera, Luteococcus, Marinilactibacillus and Vagococcus, for which no genome sequences were available. Draft genomes sequences were produced, and 117 among 142 were suitable for public databases and submitted, mainly at high quality level. As a proof of concept for the use of VHTST profiling, the microbial composition of the surfaces of two smear cheeses and one blue-veined cheese was analyzed with the use of these new genomes. A significant part of the cheese microbiota was composed of microorganisms that were not deliberately inoculated, including Gram-negative genera such as Pseudoalteromonas, Halomonas, Vibrio, Marinilactibacillus and Psychrobacter.  The depth of this metagenomic analysis revealed the presence of strains sharing almost complete gene set with over 99.9% identity with newly sequenced strains. They may correspond to "terroir" strains that add typical values to traditional productions. The availability of the genomes sequenced in the present study and particularly those which are not deliberately inoculated, and the broaden use of VHTST will considerably extend our understanding of cheese microbiota, and of genetic determinants involved in the generation of desirable or undesirable properties.

SRP029352	Parvo-like Hybrid Virus Metagenome	NGS metagenomics datasets with sequences corresponding to parvo-like hybrid virus.  Next-generation sequencing was used for discovery and de novo assembly of a novel, highly divergent DNA virus at the interface between the Parvoviridae and Circoviridae. The virus, provisionally named â€œparvovirus-likeâ€ hybrid virus (PHV), is nearly identical by sequence to another DNA virus, NIH-CQV, previously reported in Chinese patients with seronegative (non-A-E) hepatitis. Although we initially detected PHV in a wide range of clinical samples, with all strains sharing ~99% nucleotide and amino acid identity with each other and with NIH-CQV, the exact origin of the virus was eventually traced to contaminated silica-binding spin columns used for nucleic acid extraction. Definitive confirmation of the origin of PHV, and presumably NIH-CQV, was obtained by in-depth analyses of water eluted through contaminated spin columns. Analysis of environmental metagenome libraries detected PHV sequences in coastal marine waters of North America, suggesting that a potential association between PHV and diatoms (algae) that generate the silica matrix used in the spin columns may have resulted in inadvertent viral contamination during manufacture. The confirmation of PHV / NIH-CQV as laboratory reagent contaminants and not bona fide infectious agents of humans underscores the rigorous approach needed to establish the validity of new viral genomes discovered by next-generation sequencing.

SRP009908	Improved primers and a pyrosequencing approach recover wide range of nitrogen reductase genes from peatlands	Oligonucleotides used for the amplification of nitrogen reductase (nifH like)   gene  fragments  from  environmental  samples  were  re-examined  for  use  in  a   project   designed   to   survey   microbial   communities   in   Canada's   boreal   ecosystem.  A  wide  diversity  of  nitrogen  reductase  gene  sequences  were   aligned, revealing that commonly used primers for the amplification of  nifH   gene   fragments   are   inadequate   for   targeting   the   full   range   of   sequence   variants in the database.  Conserved  regions  were  used  to  design  improved   redundant  primers  which were  synthesized  with  bar  codes  and  sequencing   adaptors  attached.  The  PCR  products from 16 peatland samples  were  mixed   with other amplicons representing a range of phylogenetic and functional gene   targets, and sequenced on a Roche FLX sequencing platform.   Products from   different gene targets and samples were separated after sequencing based on   string  recognition  programs.     Nitrogen  reductase  gene  sequences  were   analyzed  and  compared  to  others  in  the  database.  Our  primers  target  all   known nifH, vnfH and anfH like sequences from each of the previously defined   clusters  I,  II  ,  III,  and  IV.   We  recovered  sequences  from  peat  samples  that   belong  to  clusters  I,  III,  IV,  and  many  intermediate  sequences  that  call  into   question the integrity of the previously defined clusters. We also amplified a   high  diversity  of  protochlorophyllide  reductase  gene  (frxC  like)  sequences  as   these  genes  share  most  of  the  conserved  protein  motif  of  the  nitrogenase   reductases.  The study demonstrated the utility of pyrosequencing for multiple   barcoded amplicons from multiple samples.

ERP009854	Deeply sequenced metagenome and metatranscriptome of a biogas-producing microbial community from an agricultural production-scale biogas plant	Background Most of the organisms of biogas communities are still unknown and non-cultivable. Accordingly, metagenome sequencing is currently the only possibility to obtain insights into community composition and the genetic repertoire.  Findings We report the first deeply sequenced metagenome and metatranscriptome of a biogas-producing microbial community from an agricultural production-scale biogas plant. Our metagenome assembly reconstructed most genes involved in methane metabolism, a key pathway involving methanogenesis populated by low-abundance archaea, indicating sufficient coverage for many downstream analyses.  Conclusions Sequenced at least one order of magnitude deeper than previous studies, our metagenome data will enable novel insights into community composition and the genetic potential of important community members. Moreover, mapping of transcripts to reconstructed genome sequences will enable the identification of active metabolic pathways in target organisms.

ERP001568	Detoxification of arsenic mediated by microbial sulphate reduction in                 Mediterranean marine sediments	Micro-organisms which dwell in sediments have a crucial role in                 biogeochemical cycles and are thus expected to have a strong influence on the cycle                 of arsenic, a metalloid responsible for severe water pollution and presenting a                 major health risk for the populations. Nowadays, environmental genomics techniques                 allow to study the adaptive and cooperative strategies of microbial communities                 thriving in polluted environments. We sequenced the sediment metagenomes from                 l'Estaque marina (Marseille, France), close to a former metallurgic industrial site                 highly polluted with arsenic, and from St Mandrier marina, near Toulon (France). The                 functional and taxonomic profiles of both metagenomes, along with those from four                 publicly available metagenomes used as control data sets, were obtained using the                 RAMMCAP workflow. The biodiversity was higher in both harbour sediment communities                 in comparison to the controls. The order of Desulfobacterales represented 54.7% of                 the observed orders in l'Estaque and 31.7% in St Mandrier. Other orders were evenly                 distributed though the diversity was lower in the highly polluted site of l'Estaque                 than in St Mandrier. The Gene Ontology (GO) entries describing the functional                 profiles were compared with the controls in order to highlight the over-represented                 categories in the metagenomes of interest. We observed that categories related to                 arsenic resistance and oxidative stress were over-represented in l'Estaque. More                 importantly, the integration of metagenomic and physico-chemical data showed that in                 l'Estaque, dissimilatory sulphate reduction in the upper layer of sediment could                 increase arsenic diffusion to the water column and deeper layers, resulting in local                 detoxification of the sediment.

SRP046836	Soil fungal communities Metagenome	The objective of this study was to understand the effect of soil P level and the composition of grassland plants, in particular the presence of N-fixing legumes on the structure and diversity of AM and other fungi. We examined four plant assemblage treatments: (1) a mix of seven grass species that are native to the region, (2) the native grass mix grown with the domesticated N-fixing legume Medicago sativa, (3) the native grass mix grown with the native N-fixing legume Dalea purpurea, and (4) the introduced grass Bromus biebersteinii grown with M. sativa. The mix of B. biebersteinii and M. sativa is commonly used in the semi-arid zone of the Canadian Prairie. These plant assemblage treatments were crossed with P fertilization, with each plant assemblage receiving either 0 or 200 kg ha-1 of P2O5 as triple super-phosphate at seeding, two years prior to this experiment. We harvested soil samples in two consecutive years (2008 and 2009), extracted total DNA, used PCR amplification to target either the AM fungal community (18S rDNA) or total fungal community (ITS), and sequenced these amplicons using 454-FLX Titanium technology. In forage stands, the inclusion of N-fixing legumes and/or the addition of P fertilizer are common practices to increase plant yield, while these treatments may modify soil fungal diversity and function.

ERP012836	Complete nitrification by a single microorganism	Nitrification is a two-step process where ammonia was considered to first be oxidized to nitrite by ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and/or archaea (AOA), and subsequently to nitrate by nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB). Described by Winogradsky already in 1890, this division of labour between the two functional groups is a central dogmagenerally accepted characteristic of the biogeochemical nitrogen cycle. Complete oxidation of ammonia to nitrate in one organism (complete ammonia oxidation; comammox) is energetically feasible and it was postulated that this process could occur under conditions selecting for organisms with lower growth-rates but higher growth-yields than canonical ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms (AOM). Still, the organisms catalysing this process have not yet been discovered. Here, we report the enrichment and initial characterization of two Nitrospira species that encode all enzymes necessary for ammonia oxidation via nitrite to nitrate in their genomes, and indeed completely oxidize ammonium to nitrate to conserve energy. Their ammonia monooxygenase (AMO) enzymes are phylogenetically distinct from their counterparts in AOM, rendering recent acquisition by horizontal gene transfer from known AOM unlikely. We also found highly similar amoA sequences (encoding the AMO subunit A) in public sequence databases, which were apparently misclassified as methane monooxygenases. The recognition of a novel amoA sequence group and the discovery of the long-sought-after comammox process will not only shed new light on the environmental abundance and distribution of AOM, but also change our perception of the nitrogen cycle.

ERP002047	Metagenomic analysis of Neandertal bone Vi33.16 sequences.	BACKGROUND: The Neandertal genome was recently sequenced using DNA extracted from a 38,000-year-old fossil. At the start of the project, the fraction of mammalian and bacterial DNA in the sample was estimated to < 6% and 9%, respectively. Treatment with restriction enzymes prior to sequencing increased the relative proportion of mammalian DNA to 15%, but the large majority of sequences remain uncharacterized. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Our taxonomic profiling based on the analyses of 3.95 Gb of Neandertal DNA isolated from the Vindija Neandertal Vi33.16 fossil showed that 90% of about 50,000 rRNA sequence reads were of bacterial origin and that actinobacteria accounted more than 75% of the bacterial rRNA sequences. Likewise, actinobacteria represented more than 80% of the PCR-amplified 16S rRNA sequences from a cave sediment sample taken from the same G layer as the Neandertal bone. We assembled all 16S rRNA sequence read assigned to Streptomycetales, and analysed the patterns of nucleotide differences in the individual sequence reads compared to assembled consensus sequences. The typical ancient nucleotide substitution pattern with a majority of C to T changes indicative of DNA damage was observed for the Neandertal rRNA sequences, but not for the Streptomyces-like rRNA sequences. SIGNIFICANCE: Our analyses suggest that actinobacteria, and especially members of the Streptomycetales, contribute the majority of sequences in the DNA extracted from the Neandertal fossil Vi33.16. The bacterial DNA showed no signs of damage, and we hypothesize that it was derived from cave sediment bacteria that have been enriched inside the bone. The bioinformatic approach used here paves the way for future studies of microbial communities and patterns of DNA damage in bacteria from archaeological bones. Such studies can help identify targeted measures, such as selective degradation of bacterial DNA with particular base composition patterns, to increase the relative amount of ancient DNA in the sample.

SRP096065	A first insight into the metagenome and virome of a human impacted ecosystem in Patagonia	Microbes are fundamental drivers of ecosystems and their activities shape the biogeochemistry of the planet. Disruption of microbial ecosystem activities may result in pathogenic shifts that affect not only the environment but also human populations, i.e., harmful algal blooms; reservoirs of antibiotic resistance (AR). In particular, the emergence of AR could be summarized as an evolutionary arms race where microbes exhibit an uncanny ability to flank every human attempt to attack infection.These samples correspond to three sampling sites located at the head of the Comau fjord in Northern Patagonia (42Âº S), in a region of intensive open-cage salmon aquaculture. The overarching project aims to characterize microbial communities along the Comau fjiord by using culture-independent methods and to compare their structure with the distribution of mobile genetic elements, class-1 integrons, and genetic determinants of antimicrobial resistance.

ERP016407	Functional redundancy in peat microbial community after 18-years of in situ experimental manipulations mimicking climate warming and increased nutrient deposition	Given the pressures from anthropogenic perturbations, it is important to understand ecosystem responses to multiple stressors over long time scales at in situ conditions. Such information can guide management strategies and help predict future characteristics and services of an ecosystem. Here, we investigated the combined effect of 18 years simulated deposition of nitrogen (N), sulfate (S) and warming on taxonomic diversity and genome-encoded traits in peat microbial communities using in situ manipulation of a boreal oligotrophic minerogenic mire. The three perturbations individually effected 16S rRNA based prokaryotic community composition, where N addition had the most pronounced effect, and  combinations with the other treatments led to additive effects. Yet, responses in the functional gene repertoire, as characterized by shotgun metagenomics, were mostly insignificant, except in connection to combined perturbations. The strong responses in taxonomical composition in contrast to minor responses in genome-encoded traits and ecosystem scale functions (e.g. methane emissions) points to functional redundancy as a â€˜biodiversity guardâ€™ that maintains ecosystem functioning when challenged with multiple stressors, thus, buffering against future changes in green house gases and carbon exchange.

Here we show that p12 proteins engineered to encode peptide sequences derived from known viral tethering proteins can direct chromatin binding during the early phase of viral replication and rescue a lethal p12-PM14 mutant. Peptides studied included segments of Kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA)1-23, human papillomavirus 8 E2, and prototype foamy virus chromatin-binding sequences. Amino acid substitutions in Kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus LANA and prototype foamy virus chromatin-binding sequences that blocked nucleosome association failed to rescue MuLV p12-PM14. Rescue by a larger LANA peptide, LANA1-32, required second-site mutations that are predicted to reduce peptide binding af?nity to chromosomes, suggesting that excessively high binding af?nity interfered with Gag/p12 function. This is supported by confocal microscopy of chimeric p12-GFP fusion constructs showing the reverted proteins had weaker association to condensed mitotic chromosomes. Analysis of the integration-site selection of these chimeric viruses showed no significant change in integration pro?le compared with wild-type MuLV, suggesting release of the tethered p12 post mitosis, before viral integration.

DRP001235	Metagenomic analyses of microbial communities generating electricity from methanol	Methanol is widely used in industrial processes as a fuel, solvent and raw chemical material, and large quantities are discharged into wastewaters. Although microbial fuel cells (MFCs) are expected as devices that recover electric energy from organic pollutants in wastewater, there has been no report demonstrating that electricity isgenerated from methanol in MFCs. In the present study, single-chamber MFCs were inoculated with activated sludge obtained from an industrial wastewater-treatment plant and fed methanol as the sole carbon and energy source. After operating the MFC for several months, electricity was generated from methanol with the maximum power density of 210 mW m-2 (based on an anode projection area) and Coulombic efficiency of 15%. An anode-replacement test indicated that electricity was mainly generated by anode-biofilm microbes. Bacterial communities in the anode biofilm, cathode biofilm and electrolyte were analyzed by pyrotag sequencing of 16S rRNA-gene PCR amplicons, showing that they were relatively similar and substantially different from that in the original activated sludge. Major genera commonly detected in these samples included Dysgonomonas, Sporomusa, and Desulfovibrio, while Geobacter was detected only in the anode biofilm. Results suggest a possibility that methanol was converted to electricity under a syntrophic association of Geobacter with Sporomusa. This idea was supported by Illumina shotgun metagenomic analyses of the anode-biofilm community, suggesting that the initial step in the methanol degradation is catalyzed by corrinoid-dependent methyltransferases harbored by Sporomusa.

Dietary agents have been considered the primary environmental exposure to promote colorectal cancer development. However, the colonic mucosa is permanently in contact with the microbiota and its metabolic products including toxins that also have the potential to trigger oncogenic transformation. The goal of this study was to analyze fecal DNA for microbiota composition and functional potential in African Americans with pre-neoplastic lesions. This study reveals that at the pre-neoplastic stages, there is a trend showing microbiota changes between healthy and colon polyp patients at the sub-genus level.

SRP109166	Methanethiol-dependent dimethylsulfide production in soil environments	Dimethylsulfide (DMS) is an environmentally important trace gas with roles in sulphur cycling, signalling to higher organisms and in atmospheric chemistry. DMS is believed to be predominantly produced in marine environments via microbial degradation of the osmolyte dimethylsulfoniopro- pionate (DMSP). However, significant amounts of DMS are also generated from terrestrial environments, for example, peat bogs can emit ~ 6 Âµmol DMS m - 2 per day, likely via the methylation of methanethiol (MeSH). A methyltransferase enzyme termed â€˜MddAâ€™, which catalyses the methylation of MeSH generating DMS in a wide range of bacteria and some cyanobacteria, may mediate this process, as the mddA gene is abundant in terrestrial metagenomes. This is the first study investigating the functionality of MeSH-dependent DMS production (Mdd) in a wide range of aerobic environments. All soils and marine sediment samples tested produced DMS when incubated with MeSH. Cultivation-dependent and cultivation-independent methods were used to assess microbial community changes in response to MeSH addition in a grassland soil where 35.9% of the bacteria were predicted to contain mddA. Bacteria of the genus Methylotenera were enriched in the presence of MeSH. Furthermore, many novel Mdd+ bacterial strains were isolated. Despite the abundance of mddA in the grassland soil, the Mdd pathway may not be a significant source of DMS in this environment as MeSH addition was required to detect DMS at only very low conversion rates.

ERP001178	Arctic Winter marine ecosystem	Polar winter waters are one of the least studied marine ecosystems with                 regard to microbial life and Thaumarchaeota are key microorganisms in this                 environment. We collected data on abundance and metabolic activity of Thaumarchaeota                 in Arctic and Antarctic waters in different seasons, including the wintertime. As                 previously observed, Arctic Thaumarchaeota grew throughout the winter, increasing                 their abundances one order of magnitude from January to March 2008. Yet,                 paradoxically, in situ single-cell measurements revealed an unexpected low metabolic                 activity for this group in both polar systems, i.e., less than 5% of archaeal cells                 taking up leucine or bicarbonate, inconsistent with known heterotrophic or                 autotrophic archaeal lifestyles. To resolve how archaea obtain energy and carbon for                 growth, we analyzed a metagenome collected during the Arctic winter, when the                 Thaumarchaeota population was at its maximum of abundance (18% of cell counts).                 Metagenomics and quantitative PCR showed that archaeal amoA genes were abundant in                 Arctic and Antarctic waters, indicating that polar Thaumarchaeota have the potential                 for ammonia oxidation. The presence of a large number of archaeal genes involved in                 urea transport and degradation together with detectable uptake of 14C-labeled urea                 by the prokaryotic assemblage, suggest that the products of urea hydrolysis (NH3 and                 CO2) may be sources of both energy and carbon for polar ammonia oxidizing archaea.                 This hypothesis, consistent with the idea of polar archaea growing as nitrifiers but                 with apparent low incorporation of bicarbonate, would provide the molecular basis                 for the recurrent archaeal growth in polar winter waters.

SRP006846	Mid-Atlantic Bight Microbial Observatory Targeted Locus	Surface water samples were collected monthly from a site beyond the mouth of the Delaware Bay (38Â° 50.935'' N, 75Â° 06.456'' W) The carbon cycle and other biogeochemical processes in the oceans were thought to be controlled nearly entirely by two types of marine microbes: 1) phototrophs - microbes which, like plants, synthesize organic material using CO2 and other plant nutrients while producing oxygen; and 2) heterotrophs - microbes which, like animals, oxidize organic material back to CO2 and other plant nutrients while using oxygen. Recent studies using molecular approaches have discovered some novel microbes--photoheterotrophs--that combine phototrophy with heterotrophy. Photoheterotrophy would fundamentally alter our understanding of the carbon cycle and other biogeochemical processes in aquatic ecosystems. p This project addresses questions about the diversity, abundance, and activity of photoheterotrophic microbes in the Mid-Atlantic Bight.

It is not clear whether and how the gut or oral microbial community is compositionally and functionally altered in RA, and whether and how the microbiota at different body sites overlap. Here we perform whole-genome shotgun sequencing for fecal, dental and salivary samples from a large cohort of RA patients, analyze metagenomic linkage groups to construct an RA classifier, and assemble a pathogenâ€™s draft genome using SOAPMeta.

ERP009837	Transcriptome and Metabolite Profiling of the Infection Cycle of Zymoseptoria tritici on Wheat Reveals a Biphasic Interaction with Plant Immunity Involving Differential Pathogen Chromosomal Contributions and a Variation on the Hemibiotrophic Lifestyle Definition.	The hemibiotrophic fungus Zymoseptoria tritici causes Septoria tritici blotch disease of wheat (Triticum aestivum). Pathogen reproduction on wheat occurs without cell penetration, suggesting that dynamic and intimate intercellular communication occurs between fungus and plant throughout the disease cycle. We used deep RNA sequencing and metabolomics to investigate the physiology of plant and pathogen throughout an asexual reproductive cycle of Z. tritici on wheat leaves. Over 3,000 pathogen genes, more than 7,000 wheat genes, and more than 300 metabolites were differentially regulated. Intriguingly, individual fungal chromosomes contributed unequally to the overall gene expression changes. Early transcriptional down-regulation of putative host defense genes was detected in inoculated leaves. There was little evidence for fungal nutrient acquisition from the plant throughout symptomless colonization by Z. tritici, which may instead be utilizing lipid and fatty acid stores for growth. However, the fungus then subsequently manipulated specific plant carbohydrates, including fructan metabolites, during the switch to necrotrophic growth and reproduction. This switch coincided with increased expression of jasmonic acid biosynthesis genes and large-scale activation of other plant defense responses. Fungal genes encoding putative secondary metabolite clusters and secreted effector proteins were identified with distinct infection phase-specific expression patterns, although functional analysis suggested that many have overlapping/redundant functions in virulence. The pathogenic lifestyle of Z. tritici on wheat revealed through this study, involving initial defense suppression by a slow-growing extracellular and nutritionally limited pathogen followed by defense (hyper) activation during reproduction, reveals a subtle modification of the conceptual definition of hemibiotrophic plant infection.

SRP039396	Kartchner Caverns Fungal ITS1 Targeted Locus Project	Samples were collected in Kartchner Caverns, a carbonate cave in southern Arizona, USA. This cave is characterized by oligotrophic conditions, high humidity and elevated carbon dioxide levels. These characteristics make it a challenging environment for microbial survival. In 2006, Kartchner was designated a National Science Foundation Microbial Observatory for which a major goal is to determine the structure and diversity of cave microbes. This project addresses that goal by investigating the diversity and structure of fungal communities from mineral surfaces within the cave. A total of 24 speleothem and 24 rock wall swab samples were collected along a transect through the cave. Genomic DNA was extracted from each sample and the ITS1 region of the fungal rRNA gene was amplified and sequenced using 454 pyrosequencing.	SRR1182556

SRP063707	Bacteria metagenome	Skin microbiome studies are increasingly common, due in part to affordable and accessible sequencing and analysis platforms. Compared to culture-based techniques, DNA sequence-based methods, such as sequencing of the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene, provide more precise microbial community characterizations. Although outcomes of microbiome studies heavily depend on the protocols employed, skin-specific approaches have not been optimized. Here we establish a resource for the cutaneous research community to guide skin microbiome experimental design. We compare 16S rRNA gene tag sequencing to whole metagenomic shotgun (WMS) sequencing for deciphering skin microbiome community composition, diversity, and function. We show that reported relative abundance of skin microbiota depends on the region of the 16S rRNA gene that is amplified and sequenced. Primers widely used for studies of the gastrointestinal microbiome poorly recapitulate relative abundance of the skin commensal Propionibacterium. Alternatively, sequencing of hypervariable regions 1-3 provides similar genus-level classifications of bacterial communities to WMS sequencing. A perceived advantage of WMS sequencing is that it provides evidence of a communityâ€™s functional potential; however, metagenome predictions based on 16S rRNA sequence tags closely approximate WMS genetic functional profiles. This work highlights the importance of experimental design and recommends optimal strategies for skin microbiome studies.	SRR2549647

ERP010250	Regulators of Gut Motility Revealed by a Gnotobiotic Model of Diet-Microbiome Interactions Related to Travel	To understand how different diets, the consumersâ€™ gut microbiota, and the enteric nervous system (ENS) interact to regulate gut motility, we developed a gnotobiotic mouse model that mimics short-term dietary changes that happen when humans are traveling to places with different culinary traditions. Studying animals transplanted with the microbiota from humans representing each cuisine and fed a sequence of diets representing those of all donors, we find that correlations between bacterial species abundances and transit times are diet dependent. However, the levels of unconjugated bile acids â€” reflecting microbial bile salt hydrolase activity â€” correlate with faster transit across diets, including a Bangladeshi diet. Mice harboring a consortium of sequenced bacterial strains from the Bangladeshi donorâ€™s microbiota and fed a Bangladeshi diet revealed that the commonly used spice, turmeric, slows transit times. Turmeric affects gut motility via bacterial bile acid deconjugation and modulation of Ret signaling in the ENS. These results demonstrate how a single food ingredient interacts with a functional microbiota trait to regulate host physiology.

Here we used metatranscriptomic analysis of rRNA depleted RNA from the rhizospheres of wheat, oat, pea and unplanted soil to compare the metabolic functions of microbes in these environments. Using biological replication (n=5) we were able to give statisistical significance to the differences found. Microbes responsed to the rhizosphere environment by increasing metabolic activity in general, and particularly in metabolic pathways involved in sugar, organic acid and aromatics metabolism, oxidative stress, and motility. While general rhizosphere effects on the microbial communities were observed, many specific effects were plant species dependent.	ERR566382,ERR566385,ERR566386,ERR566391
SRP092628	swab samples from amphibians Genome sequencing	Chytridiomycosis is an amphibian disease caused by the fungal pathogens Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) and Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans (Bsal). Bsal was recently described as a second Batrachochytrium sp. after salamander die-off events in Europe. Movement of Bsal and its introduction to novel regions via trade is a prime concern because of possible threats to salamander biodiversity and loss of ecosystem services they provide. Here, we used next generation sequencing to determine if Bsal was present in external swab samples of wild, North American amphibians (Oregon, USA). Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology was employed to further delineate the differences found between the qPCR and end-point PCR 28S rDNA assays. The NGS sequences suggested a mixture of fungal organisms were present in the Oregon samples, with no matches to Bsal. Our results do not fully resolve whether Bsal is present in North America, but no disease characteristics have been observed, we believe resource managers should be made aware of the potential.

ERP010213	Coupled metagenomic and metatransciptomic study of the Columbia River coastal margin salinity gradient	Microbial communities mediate the biogeochemical cycles that drive ecosystems, and it is important to understand how these communities are affected by changing environmental conditions, especially in complex coastal zones. As fresh and marine waters mix in estuaries and river plumes, the salinity, temperature, and nutrient gradients that are generated strongly influence bacterioplankton community structure, yet, a parallel shift in functional diversity has not been described. Metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analyses were conducted on five water samples spanning the salinity gradient of the Columbia River coastal margin, including river, estuary, plume, and ocean, in August 2010. Samples were pre-filtered through 3 Âµm filters and collected on 0.2 Âµm filters, thus results were focused on changes among free-living microbial communities. Results from metagenomic 16S rRNA sequences showed taxonomically distinct bacterial communities in river, estuary, and coastal ocean. Despite the strong salinity gradient observed over sampling locations (0 to 33), the functional gene profiles in the metagenomes were very similar from river to ocean with an average similarity of 82%. The metatranscriptomes, however, were an average of only 31% similar. We observed shifts from river to ocean in the abundance of genes encoding specific functions, such as catabolic pathways, osmoregulators, and metal transporters. Additionally, genes specifying both bacterial oxygenic and anoxygenic photosynthesis were highly abundant and expressed in the estuary and plume. Denitrification genes were found throughout the Columbia River coastal margin, and most highly expressed in the estuary. Across a river to ocean gradient, the free-living microbial community followed three different patterns of diversity: 1) the taxonomy of the community shifted strongly with salinity, 2) metabolic potential was highly similar across samples, with only small differences in functional gene abundance from river to ocean, and 3) gene expression was highly variable and generally was independent of changes in salinity.

ERP010965	The gut DNA viromes of Malawian twins discordant for severe acute undernutrition	The bacterial component of the human gut microbiota undergoes a definable program of postnatal development. Evidence is accumulating that this program is disrupted in children with severe acute malnutrition (SAM) and that their persistent gut microbiota immaturity, which is not durably repaired with current ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF) interventions, is causally related to disease pathogenesis. To further characterize gut microbial community development in healthy versus malnourished infants/children, we performed a time-series metagenomic study of DNA isolated from virus-like particles (VLPs) recovered from fecal samples collected during the first 30 months of postnatal life from eight pairs of mono- and dizygotic Malawian twins concordant for healthy growth, and 12 twin pairs discordant for SAM (either marasmus or kwashiorkor). Both members of discordant pairs were sampled just prior to, during and after treatment with a peanut-based RUTF. Using Random Forests and a dataset of 17,676 viral contigs assembled from shotgun sequencing reads of VLP DNAs, we identified viruses that distinguish different assembly stages of the gut microbiota in the concordant healthy twin pairs. This normal developmental program was impaired in both members of SAM discordant pairs and not repaired with RUTF. Phage plus viruses belonging to the Anelloviridae and Circoviridae families of single-stranded eukaryotic viruses discriminate  discordant pairs from concordant healthy pairs. These results disclose that apparently healthy co-twins in discordant pairs have viromes indicative of familial risk for SAM and provide a human model for delineating normal versus perturbed postnatal acquisition and retention of the gut microbiotaâ€™s viral component in populations at risk for malnutrition.

SRP031624	Pavilion Lake, British Columbia Targeted Locus (Loci)	Pavilion Lake is a slightly alkaline, freshwater lake located in British Columbia, Canada. It is known for unusual organosedimentary structures, called microbialites that are found along the lake basin. These deposits are complex associations of fossilized microbial communities and detrital- or chemical-sedimentary rocks. During the summer, a sediment sample was collected from near the lakeâ€™s shore, approximately 25-50 cm below the water surface. Magnetotactic bacteria (MTB) were isolated from this sample using a simple magnetic enrichment protocol. The MTB isolated from Pavilion Lake belonged to the Alphaproteobacteria (69%) or Gammaproteobacteria (31%) classes as determined by 16S rDNA. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that the bacteria were spirillum-shaped and contained a single chain of cuboctahedral-shaped magnetite (Fe3O4) crystals that were approximately 40 nm in diameter. This discovery of MTB in Pavilion Lake offers an opportunity to better understand the diversity of MTB habitats, the geobiological function of MTB in unique freshwater ecosystems, and possibly search for magnetofossils contained within the lakeâ€™s microbialites.

SRP004929	Chasing shadows in the deep - exploring hydrothermal vent microbial communities using RNA and DNA	Hidden deep beneath the ocean surface, hydrothermal vents are but one of the fascinating ecosystems that DNA sequencing technology has helped shed light on. Using a combination of amplicon- and shotgun sequencing of the small-subunit ribosomal RNA and its gene, we examined the composition and diversity of a microbial mat community from the recently discovered Jan Mayen vent field, located on Mohnâ€™s Ridge in the Norwegian-Greenland Sea. The community was dominated by the Epsilonproteobacterial genera Sulfurimonas and Sulfurovum. These are microaerobic mesophiles that mainly derive energy from the oxidation of sulphur compounds typically found in vent fluid mixing zones. Composition and diversity predictions differed systematically between extracted DNA and RNA samples as well as between amplicon sequencing and shotgun sequencing. These differences were more substantial than those between two biological replicates. Amplicon vs. shotgun sequencing differences could be explained to a large extent by bias introduced during PCR, caused by preferential primer-template annealing, while DNA vs. RNA differences were thought to be caused by differences between the activity levels between taxa. Further, predicted diversity from RNA samples was consistently lower than from DNA. In summary, this study illustrates how different methods can provide complementary ecological insights.

ERP004207	Sequencing, assembly and annotation of an anaerobic ammonium oxidizing (anammox) enrichment culture dominated by candidatus Brocadia fulgida.	Candidatus Brocadia fulgida is a bacterium capable of anaerobic oxidation of ammonium. We have sequenced an enrichment culture obtained in a membrane bioreactor (Van der Star, 2008) consisting for over 90% of candidatus Brocadia fulgida. Sequencing was done using an IonTorrent PGM with a 200bp protocol (life technologies).  The 5250695 reads were trimmed and assembled using the CLC genomics workbench (CLCbio) and 411 contigs (>500bp) were extracted based on coverage. These 411 contigs were annotated using prokka v1.7.2 (VBC)  and curated manually   --- van der Star, Wouter RL, et al. "The membrane bioreactor: a novel tool to grow anammox bacteria as free cells."

SRP043371	Linking soil bacterial biodiversity and soil carbon stability	Linking soil bacterial biodiversity and soil carbon stability  Soil carbon (C) can be lost in response to fresh C inputs, a phenomenon observed for decades yet still not understood. Using dual-stable isotope probing, we show that changes in the diversity and composition of two functional bacterial groups mediate this â€œprimingâ€ effect. A single substrate pulse suppressed soil C loss and reduced bacterial diversity, whereas repeated substrate pulses stimulated soil C loss and the diversity, and also altered the composition of the soil bacterial community. This increased diversity response after repeated labile C amendments contrasts with resource competition theory, which might be explained by increased predation as evidenced by a decrease in 16S rRNA gene abundance. Our results suggest that the biodiversity and composition of the soil microbial community changes in concert with its functioning, with consequences for soil C stability.	SRR1424791,SRR1424792

SRP008662	Profiles of Hydrocarbon Metabolites Reflect Functional Redundancy between Distinct Microbiomes of Alaskan North Slope Oil Fields	Microorganisms can have an undeniable impact on oil production through their roles in the biodegradation of hydrocarbons and corrosion of metal surfaces.  The ever-increasing demand for fossil fuels from limited reservoirs and an aging infrastructure has exacerbated the need to better understand how reservoir properties and management practices influence the composition of microbial communities and their metabolic activities.  In this study, we identify the potential metabolites of hydrocarbon degradation and microbial community profiles throughout two oil fields on the Alaskan North Slope.  Field A, a younger facility, with lower temperatures, and seawater recharging, had metabolites of mostly â€œlighterâ€ hydrocarbons and was dominated by Proteobacteria.  Field B, which is older, with higher temperatures, and recycles its productions fluids, has a greater diversity of hydrocarbon metabolites and is dominated by members of the Firmicutes and Synergistes.  Samples from the same field contained similar metabolite profiles and bacterial communities.  The properties of the oil reservoirs, oil production practices, and overall temperatures are likely the factors driving the microbial community structures and functions.

ERP017091	The gut microbiome in Crohn's disease and modulation by exclusive enteral nutrition	AbstractBackgroundInflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), with Crohnâ€™s disease (CD) being one of the primary types, have been extensively studied for genetic and gut microbial factors leading to its epidemic in the modern world. However, limited information using metagenomic shotgun-sequencing to pinpoint the gut microbial species and functions involved. Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is a nutritional therapy used for disease-modifying treatment of CD, but its impact on the gut microbiome remains unclear. ResultsWe collected 123 stool samples from 49 CD patients, 14 of whom were resampled after 2 weeks of EEN, and 56 subjects with no disease. Metagenomic shotgun sequencing and analyses confirmed a decreased diversity in the gut microbiota of CD patients, and identified microbial species and potential functions altered in CD, most notably an increased ratio of hexa- to penta-acylated lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Some co-abundance gene groups (CAGs) including Parabacteroides distasonis, Bacteroides intestinalis, Ruminococcus sp. showed strong correlation with clinical indicators such as hs.CRP, Prealbumin, platelets and BMI. The entire cohort could be divided into three types according to their species composition, with Type A largely consisting of healthy controls and Type C containing exclusively CD or after EEN samples. Although compositional changes were generally mild after 2 weeks of EEN, remodeling of the gut microbial network could be observed.ConclusionsOur metagenomic dataset unlock the gut microbiome in CD for functional investigations. Microbiome-based stratification of CD patients before EEN might help optimize the therapy for wider applications.

SRP000673	Metagenomic analysis of viruses in reclaimed water	Reclaimed water use is an important component of sustainable water resource management. This study characterized the viral community found in reclaimed water and compared it to viruses in potable water.  Reclaimed water contained 1000-fold more virus-like particles (VLPs) than potable water, having approximately 108 VLPs per milliliter. Metagenomic analyses revealed that most of the viruses in both reclaimed and potable water were novel. Bacteriophages dominated the DNA viral community in both reclaimed and potable water, but reclaimed water had a distinct phage community based on phage family distributions and host representation within each family. Eukaryotic viruses similar to plant pathogens and invertebrate picornaviruses dominated RNA metagenomic libraries. Established human pathogens were not detected in reclaimed water viral metagenomes, which contained a wealth of novel single-stranded DNA and RNA viruses related to plant, animal, and insect viruses. Therefore reclaimed water may play a role in the dissemination of highly stable viruses. Information regarding viruses present in reclaimed water but not in potable water can be used to identify new bioindicators of water quality.  Future studies will need to investigate the infectivity and host range of these viruses to evaluate the impacts of reclaimed water use on human and ecosystem health.   This study aimed to identify dominant viral types in reclaimed water and compare it to viral types in potable water. For this purpose, six metagenomic libraries were constructed from reclaimed water samples (n = 3) and potable water (n = 1). The DNA viral community was examined in reclaimed and potable water (n = 4 for DNA libraries), while RNA viruses were only studied in reclaimed water samples (n = 2 for cDNA libraries).   454 viral metagenomic sequences submitted to the Short Read Archive are available in the Project data link.

SRP051828	Basalts from the Louisville Seamount Chain (cores) Targeted Locus (Loci)	Starting in the 1980''s, microbiologists accompanying Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) and Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) expeditions have documented the presence of microbial life in deeply buried sediments and the basaltic basement (Fisk et al., 1998; Parkes et al., 1994). Active microbial life has been detected in sediments as far below the seafloor as 1626 m (Roussel et al., 2008), and the introduction of molecular biology into marine ecology led to great advances in our understanding of microbial life below the seafloor (Biddle et al., 2008; Cowen et al., 2003; Inagaki et al., 2006; Mason et al., 2010). However, the majority of the microbiology performed on ODP and IODP expeditions thus far concentrated on sediments (for example, ODP Leg 201 to the Peru Margin), with the notable exception of expeditions to the Juan de Fuca Ridge (Cowen et al., 2003; Lever et al., 2006) and the Atlantis Massif (Mason et al., 2010). Additionally, previous expeditions that did include basement sampling tended to focus on young sites - the Juan de Fuca Ridge is 3.5 Ma and the Atlantis Massif is <2 Ma. Evidence from stable isotopes (Rouxel et al., 2008) and microbial fossils (Fisk et al., 1998) suggest that there is a subsurface biosphere that may be active in older basement rocks as well. One of the objectives of Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) expedition 330, Louisville Seamount Trail, was to sample and learn about the subsurface biosphere in the Louisville Seamount Chain (LSC). This seamount chain consists of submerged, inactive volcanoes formed at the Louisville hotspot, one of three primary hotspots in the Pacific Ocean (Courtillot et al., 2003). The drilled seamounts range in age from 65 to 77 Ma (Koppers et al., 2004) and basement composition at all three consists of alternating layers of massive lava flows and basaltic breccia.

SRP042954	Tettigades undata and endosymbiont genome sequencing	Cicadas species are globally distributed and are important insects ecologically and economically. Their success depends upon amino acid providing bacteria that are harbored in specialized organs called bacteriomes. These bacteria have among the smallest genomes of any bacteria; how they function at a cellular level with such small genomes is unknown. To address this question, we sequenced the bacterial symbionts harbored by Cicada species from around the world.	SRR1339472

SRP001634	Microbial composition of samples from infant gut	The microbial composition of the gut likely contributes to a wide-range of health and disease states including intestinal inflammation, atopic disease, and possibly diseases of adulthood, such as heart disease and obesity. The early establishment of the gut microflora is suspected to have a particularly profound impact protecting the gut from infectious disease and on long-term subsequent health by predisposing individuals to atopic or autoimmune disease later in life. In contrast to the large-scale efforts of the Human Microbiome Project to characterize the microbial flora of healthy adults, relatively little has been accomplished to characterize the early establishment of the microbiota in infants.  The administration of antibiotics to infants has the capacity to profoundly affect the early acquisition, establishment, and natural maturation of commensal microflora. Prematurity is another major factor that is thought to influence ''normal'' gut microbial composition in early life. A high number of pre-term infants receive antibiotic therapy prophylactically; the immediate and long-term effects of antibiotic treatment on infant and later health outcomes are unknown. We hypothesize that gestational age influences the ability to support ''normal'' gut microbiota, and that antibiotic administration in the first few weeks of life can alter or delay the development of a ''normal'' microbiota and may lead to adverse health outcomes. If we hope to promote the healthy establishment of early gut colonization and thereby improve health outcomes, we need to establish what ''normal'' colonization looks like across gestational ages and apply this knowledge as a benchmark to understand the impact of antibiotic treatment in early postnatal life.  In this project, we propose to examine the microbiome in four cohorts ranging from extremely preterm to term, with birth weights appropriate for gestational age: Group 1) 23 to 27 weeks and extremely low birth weight [ELBW, <1000 grams]; Group 2) 28 to 32 weeks and very low birth weight [VLBW, >1000 to <1500 grams]; Group 3) 33 to 36 weeks and low birth weight [LBW, >1500 to <2500 grams]; and Group 4) term (37 to 42 weeks) and normal [>2500 to <4000 gram] birth weight.

SRP011078	Metagenomic analysis of lignocellulolytic microbial communities	 Lignocellulosic biomass is the most abundant organic carbon reservoir on earth, providing a renewable carbon source for the chemosphere and the prospective biorefinery industry. Decomposition of lignocelluloses in nature involves complex cooperative actions of various microbes producing different lignocelluloytic enzymes attacking the cellulosic and non-cellulosic components of plant biomass. To understand microbial communities and metabolic genes in lignocellulosic degradation, culture-independent direct 454 pyrosequencing metagenomes has been applied to study the diversity and metabolic capabilities in various lignocellulosic environments.  The project consists of four experiments: 1. Tagged 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing: the microbial community in lignocellulosic ecological niche has been unveiled by the high-throughput tagged 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing. The samples were collected from industrial bagasse collection site at a sugar mill; (ii) cow rumen fluid; and (iii) activated sludge from a pulp mill, and the structurally stable lignocellulolytic microbial consortia constructed from microflora in these sites using successive subcultivation method. 2. Shotgun pyrosequencing of bagasse metagenome: lignocellulolytic enzyme systems and metabolic gene potential of microorganisms in interior region of bagasse collection site were explored using shotgun metagenome pyrosequencing. 3. Shotgun pyrosequencing of microcoms in consortium: lignocellulolytic enzyme systems and metabolic gene potential of microorganisms in stable consortium were explored using shotgun metagenome pyrosequencing. 4. Fosmid bagasse library: the fosmid library was constructed from metagenome of uncultured microflora in bagasse pile by 454 pyrosequencing, which allows us to recover the genes of interest for further cloning and expression study.  This study gives insights into biodiversity and metabolic potential of lignocellulose degrading microbial communities in environments, providing a basis for understanding microbial process in nature and for biotechnological application.

SRP002395	Human Microbiome Project (HMP) 16S rRNA Gene Diversity, the diversity of 16S ribosomal RNA genes in the human microbiome: 454 Clinical Production Phase I	This HMP production phase represents pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes amplified from multiple body sites across hundreds of human subjects. There are two time points represented for a subset of these subjects. Using default protocol v4.2., data for the 16S window spanning V3-V5 was generated for all samples, with a second 16S window spanning V1-V3 generated for a majority of the samples. 16S rRNA sequencing is being used to characterize the complexity of microbial communities at individual body sites, and to determine whether there is a core microbiome at each site. Several body sites will be studied, including the gastrointestinal and female urogenital tracts, oral cavity, nasal and pharyngeal tract, and skin.

SRP045861	Rapidly induced fucosylation of intestinal epithelium sustains host-commensal symbiosis during sickness.	Systemic infection induces conserved physiological responses that include both resistance and â€˜tolerance of infectionâ€™ mechanisms. Among these responses, temporary anorexia associated with an infection is often beneficial. It poses, however, a problem for the trillions of microbes residing in the gastrointestinal tract, as they also experience reduced substrate availability. We hypothesized that under anorectic conditions caused by infection, the host might activate protective mechanisms to support the gut microbiota during the acute phase of the disease. Here, we report that systemic exposure to Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands causes rapid a1,2-fucosylation of the small intestine epithelial cells (IEC). The process requires sensing of TLR agonists and production of IL-23 by dendritic cells, activation of innate lymphoid cells and expression of a1,2-Fucosyltransferase-2 (Fut2) by IL-22-stimulated IECs. Fucosylated proteins are shed into the lumen and fucose is utilized by microbiota, as shown using reporter bacteria and by transcriptional profiling of the gut microbiome.  Fucosylation also reduces the expression of bacterial virulence genes within the commensal gut microbiome and improves host tolerance of the mild pathogen Citrobacter rodentium. Thus, rapid IEC fucosylation appears to be a protective mechanism that utilizes the hostâ€™s resources to maintain host-microbial interactions during pathogen-induced stress. Overall design: RNA-Seq analysis of the murine gut microbiome following LPS exposure. Fut2-/- (B6.129X1-Fut2tm1Sdo/J) mice were backcrossed greater than 7 generations to BALB/c. Fut2-/- (KO) and Fut2+/- (Het) animals were analyzed.	SRR1560863,SRR1560864,SRR1560865,SRR1560866,SRR1560867,SRR1560868,SRR1560869,SRR1560870,SRR1560871,SRR1560872,SRR1560873,SRR1560874

SRP067433	Comparison of meta-barcoding and shotgun metagenomic analysis of fungi associated with spontaneous wine fermentation	Wine is a complex beverage, comprised of thousands of metabolites that are produced through the action of yeasts and bacteria in fermenting grape must. To ensure a robust and reliable fermentation, most commercial wines are produced via inoculation with large amounts of the major wine yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. However, there is a growing trend towards the use of uninoculated or â€œwildâ€ fermentations, in which the yeasts and bacteria that are naturally associated with the vineyard or winery perform the fermentation. The varied metabolic contributions of the numerous non-Saccharomyces species in this microbial community are thought to impart complexity and desirable taste and aroma attributes to wild ferments when compared to their inoculated counterparts.In order the map the microflora of spontaneous fermentation, metagenomic techniques were used to characterise and monitor the progression of fungal species in several wild fermentations. Both amplicon-based ITS phylotyping and shotgun metagenomics were used to assess community structure, in addition to the isolation, sequencing and de novo assembly of the first reference genomes for several dominant wine-associated species.

SRP056252	Deep subsurface microbial communities from Mt. Terri, Switzerland - Autotrophic microbial communities BRH/23 Metagenome	The subsurface biosphere is often cited to harbor vast microbial diversity and to represent a significant contribution to the planetâ€™s biomass. There is little understanding of the metabolic processes fueling these communities and the role of lithoautotrophic growth in nutrient cycling in the subsurface. H2 from geogenic sources such as serpentinization, radiolysis of water or hydrothermal fluid circulation is proposed as a fuel for microbial metabolism in deep subsurface environments where light dependent processes are limited to residual sedimentary carbon. The aim of this project is to identify the metabolic processes supported by H2 and characterize the lithoautotrophic microorganisms in the associated microbial community and to characterize the rate of consumption of H2 in these environments to account for microbial H2 consumption in their repository safety assessment models. To pursue these aims, we have built an underground in situ reactor that is delivering H2 to a borehole in the rock located at the Mt. Terri Underground Rock Laboratory in Switzerland that is instrumented to collect information continuously.We have been monitoring sulfate, sulfide, Fe(II), H2, CH4, organic acids, major cations and anions, alkalinity, borehole pressure as well as collecting samples for metagenomic analysis and for isotopic characterization (S, H and C).

ERP001038	Mutualism between gut microbiota and the host as revealed in a comparative                 study of breast-fed versus formula-fed infants.	Ongoing efforts are directed at understanding the mutualism between the                 gut microbiota and the host in breast-fed versus formula-fed infants. Due to the                 lack of tissue biopsies, no investigators have performed a global transcriptional                 analysis of the developing intestine in healthy infants. As a result, the crosstalk                 between the microbiome and the host transcriptome in the developing                 mucosal-commensal environment has not been determined. In this study, we examined                 the host intestinal mRNA gene expression and microbial DNA profiles in full term 3                 month-old infants exclusively formula fed (FF; n=6) or breast fed (BF; n=6) from                 birth to 3 months. Host mRNA microarray measurements were performed on intact                 sloughed epithelial cells in stool samples collected at 3 months. Microbial                 composition from the same stool samples was assessed by metagenomic pyrosequencing.                 Both host mRNA expression and bacterial microbiome phylogenetic profiles provided                 strong feature sets that classified the two groups of babies (FF and BF). To                 determine the relationship between epithelial cell gene expression and the bacterial                 colony profiles, the host transcriptome and functionally profiled microbiome data                 were analyzed in a multivariate manner. From a functional perspective, analysis of                 the gut microbiota's metagenome revealed that virulence characteristics differed                 between the FF and BF babies. Using canonical correlation analysis, evidence of                 multivariate structure relating eleven host immunity/mucosal defense-related genes                 and microbiome virulence characteristics was observed. These results, for the first                 time, provide insight into the integrated responses of the host and microbiome to                 dietary substrates in the early neonatal period.

SRP035368	A cloud-compatible bioinformatics pipeline for ultra-rapid pathogen identification from next-generation sequencing of clinical samples	Unbiased next-generation sequencing (NGS) approaches enable comprehensive pathogen detection in the clinical microbiology laboratory, and have numerous applications for public health surveillance, outbreak investigation, and the diagnosis of infectious diseases. However, practical NGS deployment of the technology is hindered by the bioinformatics challenge of analyzing results accurately and in a clinically relevant timeframe. Here we describe SURPI (sequence-based ultra-rapid pathogen identification), a computational pipeline for pathogen identification from complex metagenomic NGS data generated from clinical samples. Deployable on both cloud-based and standalone servers, SURPI leverages two state-of-the-art aligners for accelerated analyses, SNAP and RAPSearch, which are as accurate as existing bioinformatics tools but orders of magnitude faster in performance. In fast mode, SURPI detects viruses and bacteria by scanning datasets of 7 - 500 million reads in 11 minutes - 5 hours, while in comprehensive mode, all known microorganisms are identified, followed by de novo assembly and protein homology searches for divergent viruses in 50 minutes â€“ 16 hours. To date, SURPI has been used for pathogen identification in over 960 clinical samples comprising more than 9 billion sequences, and has directly contributed to real-time actionable diagnosis of infections in acutely ill patients.

ERP022257	Comparison between metagenome sequencing using 16S spiking or MDA amplification	Bioinformatical research on viruses is still limited because of the low amounts of viral DNA that can be obtained for analysis. To overcome this limitation, DNA is often amplified with multiple displacement amplification (MDA), which causes an unavoidable bias. Here, we describe a DNA-spiking method to avoid the bias that is created when using amplification of DNA before metagenome sequencing. To obtain sufficient DNA for sequencing, a bacterial 16S rRNA gene was amplified and the obtained DNA was spiked to a DNA sample containing DNA from a bacteriophage population before sequencing using Ion Torrent technology. After sequencing, the 16S rRNA gene reads DNA was removed by mapping to the Silva database. The new DNA-spiking method was compared with the MDA technique.The new method provides a simple and inexpensive protocol with very low bias in sequencing of metagenomes for which low amounts of DNA are available.

SRP057267	Alaska oil reservoir Metagenome	Hydrocarbon reservoirs are major sites of methane production and carbon turnover, processes  with significant impacts on energy resources and global biogeochemical cycles. We applied a  cultivation-independent genomic approach to define microbial community membership and  predict roles for specific organisms in biogeochemical transformations in North Slope, Alaska oil  fields. Samples were collected from six locations between 1,128 m (24-27Â°C) and 2,743 m (80 -  83Â°C) below the surface. Sample complexity decreased with increasing temperature. Bacteria  from candidate phyla (CP) were highly represented in the lower temperature zones and to some  extent the intermediate temperature zones. Most microorganisms in the intermediate and higher  temperature samples were related to previously studied methanogenic and non-methanogenic  archaea and thermophilic bacteria. We reconstructed a near-complete genome for an organism  sampled from the lower temperature reservoir SB1 for an OD1 population that is present at an  abundance level close to that of the dominant Methanosaeta harundinacea population.  Consistent with prior findings for members of this lineage, the OD1 genome is small and  metabolic predictions support an obligate anaerobic, fermentation-based lifestyle. At moderate  abundance in samples were members of other CP bacteria, including TA06, OP11, OP9,  Marinimicrobia (SAR406) and OP1. For OP1 we reconstructed the first near-complete genome.  Based on the inventory of glycosyl hydrolase genes and the absence of respiratory capacity, we  infer that the predominant roles for the OP1 bacterium are fermentation of mannan, cellulose or  cell wall carbon polymers and hydrogen cycling. Overall, our results elucidate roles of  uncultivated organisms in hydrocarbon reservoir biological processes.	SRR1976948,SRR1977249,SRR1977357

SRP001166	Microbial Saltern Metagenome HighSalternSDbayMicD0704	Â­Microbial community collected July 1, 2004, from a "high" salinity saltern (32.599040, -117.107356).    A water sample from the solar saltern of South Bay Salt Works (Chula Vista, CA) was collected in July 2004 from a ponds with high salinity (28-30%), as measured using a hand refractometer. The microbial fraction was isolated from the water sample by passage through a 0.2 mkm tangential flow filter (TFF, Millipore). The retentate was kept and the microbial fraction was collected from the 0.2 mkm TFF retentate by centrifugation at ~ 2000 xg for 10 min. Microbial DNA was extracted using the Ultra Clean Soil DNA Kit (Mo Bio Laboratories, CA). The microbial DNA samples was amplified using the strand-displacement 29 DNA polymerase (GenomiPhi Amersham Biosciences, NJ). The resulting metagenomic DNA was pyrosequenced on the GS20 sequencer (454 Life Sciences, CT). The raw metagenomic sequences were screened to remove duplicate sequences. The metagenome was named HighSalternSDbayMicD200407 and submitted to NCBI.	SRR027043

SRP051265	Genomic DNA was isolated from esophageal and stomach samples collected from individuals with Barrett''s esophagus. A portion of the 16S rDNA gene was amplified and mapped to identify species. Targeted Locus (Loci)	Background: The incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) has increased nearly five-fold over the last four decades in the United States. Barrettâ€™s esophagus, the replacement of the normal squamous epithelial lining with a mucus-secreting columnar epithelium, is the only known precursor to EAC. Like other parts of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, the esophagus hosts a variety of bacteria and comparisons among published studies suggest bacterial communities in the stomach and esophagus differ. Chronic infection with Helicobacter pylori in the stomach has been inversely associated with development of EAC, but the mechanisms underlying this association remain unclear. Methodology. The bacterial composition in the upper GI tract was characterized in a subset of participants (n=12) of the Seattle Barrettâ€™s Esophagus Research cohort using broad-range 16S PCR and pyrosequencing of biopsy and brush samples collected from squamous esophagus, Barrettâ€™s esophagus, stomach corpus and stomach antrum. Three of the individuals were sampled at two separate time points. Prevalence of H. pylori infection and subsequent development of aneuploidy (n=339) and EAC (n=433) was examined in a larger subset of this cohort. Results/Significance: Within individuals, bacterial communities of the stomach and esophagus showed overlapping community membership. Despite closer proximity, the stomach antrum and corpus communities were less similar than the antrum and esophageal samples. Sampling study participants at two different time points revealed that upper GI communities could remain stable for months to years or shift dramatically over time. In this Barrettâ€™s esophagus cohort, Streptococcus and Prevotella species dominate the upper GI and the ratio of these two species is associated with waist-to-hip ratio and hiatal hernia length, two known EAC risk factors in Barrettâ€™s esophagus. H. pylori-positive individuals had a significantly decreased incidence of aneuploidy and a non-significant trend toward lower incidence of EAC.	SRR1732614,SRR1732615,SRR1732626

ERP024324	Classification and quantification of commensal lysogens and induced prophages in the gut bacterial and phage metagenomes	In this study, we estimated the fraction and distribution of lysogenic bacteria (lysogens) by using prophage detection in bacterial genomes reconstructed from mouse fecal bacterial metagenome, and characterized ecological and evolutionary relationships of commensal lysogens and temperate phages using comparisons between prophages and free phages. We found that most of commensal gut bacteria were active lysogens, and were far more abundant in rapidly growing populations, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria, supporting the â€˜Piggyback-the-Winnerâ€™ model recently proposed5. The prophages had strong and specific sequence homology to the phages, and were spontaneously induced from active lysogens in three different types of diet with composition differences. In contrary, few commensal bacteria encoded CRISPR-Cas systems being rarely active against the gut phages. Bacteria-phage interaction networks were nested and modular, in which generalist phages were connected with multiple bacteria, resulting in the prevalence of lysogeny.

SRP049336	Fracture water Metagenome	We investigated the potential for the ultradeep Au mines of South Africa to provide unique "windows" into the deep, continental biosphere through which a detailed analysis of microbial communities as a function of various environmental parameters could be performed. The depths and pressures of these mines approach those at ocean ridges and the temperatures of the mined formations lie within the zone for microbial thermophilicity (45-70oC). The microbial communities encountered in these mines are composed of a mixture of contaminating (allochthonous) and indigenous (autochthonous) microorganisms. To distinguish autochthonous from allochthonous microorganisms we developed sample collection and processing techniques that quantified and minimized the allochthonous bacterial contaminants in the mine samples. This permits evaluation of the relationship between the indigenous microbial communities and large-scale hydrogeochemical facies as well as small scale geochemical heterogeneity.

ERP015760	Longitudinal and Diurnal Experiments of M. hapla and M. truncatula	We have infected the model legume Medicago truncatula with Meloidogyne hapla and harvested tissue over a time course.  Transcriptome sequencing was performed on each sample using the Illumina RNA-Seq method.  [Longitudinal Experiment] RNA was isolated from M. hapla eggs and pre-penetration juveniles (J2)  and also from a time course of M. truncatula infected with M. hapla J2 at five time points: 1, 2, 4, 5, and 7 days after inoculation (DAI).  Roots (local) and shoots (global) tissues from infected and uninfected plants were sampled.  Each sample was loaded on five lanes for sequencing.  Collectively, 22 samples were generated in total from - M. hapla egg and J2 (two samples),  - infected M. truncatula root 1-2-4-5-7 DAI (five samples),  - infected M. truncatula shoot 1-2-4-5-7 DAI (five samples),  - uninfected M. truncatula root 1-2-4-5-7 DAI (five samples),  - and uninfected M. truncatula shoot 1-2-4-5-7 DAI (five samples).  Thus, 110 fastq files (= 22 samples x 5 lanes).  [Diunrnal Experiment] M. truncatula roots inoculated with M. hapla was sampled at 6 time-points: 22:30, 2:00, 5:00, 6:30, 14:00, and 21:00.

SRP018108	Human Oral Subgingival Plaque Microbiome	The oral microbiome, the complex ecosystem of microbes inhabiting the human mouth, harbors several thousands of bacterial types. The proliferation of pathogenic bacteria within the mouth gives rise to periodontitis, an inflammatory disease known to also constitute a risk factor for cardiovascular disease.  While much is known about individual species associated with pathogenesis, the system-level mechanisms underlying the transition from health to disease are still poorly understood. Our pilot study demonstrates the power of high-throughput sequencing as a tool for understanding the role of the oral microbiome in periodontal disease.   After the removal of supragingival plaque with sterile gauze, individual subgingival plaque samples were taken from the meio-buccal aspect of four molar teeth in four quadrants per subject using sterile periodontal curettes. Bacterial DNA extraction was performed using commercially available DNA purification kit. For 16S rRNA sequencing, DNA samples were amplified using specific primers and sequenced by 454 machines. Metagenomic shotgun sequences were obtained from the Illumina instruments.	SRR651965,SRR653184,SRR653185,SRR653417,SRR653444,SRR653445,SRR653451,SRR653452

ERP023497	Characterization of organisms recovered from metagenome sequence data of microbial biofilms residing in mesophilic and thermophilic biogas reactors	Members of the recently proposed archaeal phylum Bathyarchaeota are currently discussed to be capable of methylotrophic methanogenesis, indicating that methane metabolism also exists outside the phylum Euryarchaeota. To identify members of phylum Bathyarchaeota participating in biotechnological biogas fermentations and to unravel their putative role during anaerobic digestion and biomethanation of crop residues, microbial biofilms residing in mesophilic (37 Â°C) and thermophilic (55 Â°C) biogas fermenters were sampled. Metagenome shotgun libraries of corresponding microbiomes were prepared and sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq system. Taxonomic classification of the biofilm microbiomes revealed that between 0.1% and 2% of all classified sequences could be assigned to the phylum Bathyarchaeota. Individual metagenome assembly of the biogas microbiomes followed by genome binning resulted in reconstruction of five Bathyarchaeota genome bins (GBs) estimated to be 65% to 92% complete, featuring contamination rates of less than 10% and ranging in the genome sizes from 1.1 Mb to 2.0 Mb. Phylogenetic classification of these GBs based on core gene sets confirmed their placement within the novel archaeal phylum Bathyarchaeota. Moreover, Bathyarchaeota GBs originating from the biogas reactors cluster together within the tree and thus represent a separate group that diverged from other Bathyarchaeota groups. The genetic repertoire of the analyzed Bathyarchaeota GBs indicated an energy metabolism based on carbohydrate and amino acid fermentation with potential for extracellular hydrolysis of cellulose, cellobiose as well as proteins and corresponding transporter systems. Neither hydrogenotrophic nor aceticlastic or methylotrophic methanogenesis pathways were completely encoded in the Bathyarchaeota GBs. However, all GBs harbor genes encoding enzymes for utilization of carbon monoxide and /or carbon dioxide via the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway. Based on these findings, a hydrolytic lifestyle is proposed for the five Bathyarchaeota members represented by the GBs analyzed. This is the first study indicating that Bathyarchaeota members presumably contribute to fermentation of organic substrates and hydrolysis within the biogas production process.

SRP056255	Deep subsurface microbial communities from Mt. Terri, Switzerland - Autotrophic microbial communities BRH/37_all Metagenome	The subsurface biosphere is often cited to harbor vast microbial diversity and to represent a significant contribution to the planetâ€™s biomass. There is little understanding of the metabolic processes fueling these communities and the role of lithoautotrophic growth in nutrient cycling in the subsurface. H2 from geogenic sources such as serpentinization, radiolysis of water or hydrothermal fluid circulation is proposed as a fuel for microbial metabolism in deep subsurface environments where light dependent processes are limited to residual sedimentary carbon. The aim of this project is to identify the metabolic processes supported by H2 and characterize the lithoautotrophic microorganisms in the associated microbial community and to characterize the rate of consumption of H2 in these environments to account for microbial H2 consumption in their repository safety assessment models. To pursue these aims, we have built an underground in situ reactor that is delivering H2 to a borehole in the rock located at the Mt. Terri Underground Rock Laboratory in Switzerland that is instrumented to collect information continuously.We have been monitoring sulfate, sulfide, Fe(II), H2, CH4, organic acids, major cations and anions, alkalinity, borehole pressure as well as collecting samples for metagenomic analysis and for isotopic characterization (S, H and C).

SRP064757	Microbial carbon sequestration in a subsurface aquifer contaminated by geologic CO2	Sequestration of CO2 in the subsurface is a strategy under serious consideration to limit accumulation of anthropogenic CO2 in the atmosphere. Possible negative impacts include perturbation of biogeochemical cycles and groundwater contamination due to CO2 leakage. If sequestration stimulates growth of autotrophic microorganisms, recapture of CO2 into organic carbon would be an important feedback that could lower sequestration risks. Currently, little is known about the capacity of organisms resident in such environments to fix CO2. Here we investigated the CO2 fixation capacity of microorganisms in groundwater from the CO2â€“driven Crystal Geyser, located near Green River, Utah (USA). We reconstructed and analyzed 227 near-complete microbial genomes, representing 150 distinct species. At least 25% of the studied organisms are predicted to be autotrophs, and these represent a substantial portion the community. The most common carbon fixation pathways were the Calvin Benson Basham Cycle and Wood-Ljungdhal pathway, which incorporate readily available CO2 rather than bicarbonate. Unexpectedly, one organism from a novel phylum sibling to the candidate phyla radiation has genes of the reverse TCA cycle, which it may use to fix CO2. Autotrophic metabolism is likely supported by iron and sulfur cycling and by H2 produced by fermentation. These resources may be provided as trace components in the CO2 stream or could be liberated from minerals by carbonic acid-promoted dissolution. We predict that elevated CO2 levels will select for microbial communities enriched in organisms that can recapture CO2 into biomass, decreasing negative side effects of CO2 leakage from geological repositories.

ERP022688	Genomic estimation of complex traits reveals ancient maize adaptation to temperate North America	Maize was introduced to the southwestern US by 4,000 years ago where. Full agriculture was established quickly in the lowland deserts but delayed in the temperate uplands for 2,000 years. We tested if this delay was caused by the necessity to select for early flowering, a characteristic of modern temperate maize. We sequenced fifteen 1,900-year old maize cobs from Turkey Pen Shelter in the temperate Southwest. Indirectly validated genomic models predicted that Turkey Pen maize was marginally adapted with respect to flowering, as well as short, tillering and segregating for yellow kernel color. Population analyses suggested temperate adaptation drove modern population differentiation and was selected in situ from ancient standing variation. Validated prediction of polygenic traits in crops improves our understanding of ancient phenotypes and the dynamics of environmental adaptation. Additionally, this study is an excellent example on how to change authorship agreements right before publication.	ERR1950865
ERP010075	Investigation of Bronze Age in Eurasia by sequencing from 101 ancient human remains. We show that around 3 ka BC, Central and Northern Europe and Central Asia receive genetic input through people related to the Yamnaya Culture from the Pontic-Caspian Steppe, resulting in the formation of the Corded Ware Culture in Europe and the Afanasievo Culture in Central Asia. A thousand years later, genetic input from North-Central Europe into Central Asia gives rise to the Sintashta and Andronovo Cultures. During the late BA and Iron Age, the European-derived populations in Asia are gradually replaced by multi-ethnic cultures, of which some relate to contemporary Asian groups, while others share recent ancestry with Native American	The Bronze Age (BA) of Eurasia (c. 3,000-1,000 years BC, 3-1 ka BC) was a period of major cultural changes. Earlier hunter-gathering and farming cultures in Europe and Asia were replaced by cultures associated with completely new perceptions and technologies inspired by early urban civilization. It remains debated if these cultural shifts simply represented the circulation of ideas or resulted from large-scale human migrations, potentially also facilitating the spread of Indo-European languages and certain phenotypic traits. To investigate this and the role of BA in the formation of Eurasian genetic structure, we used new methodological improvements to sequence low coverage genomes from 101 ancient humans (19 > 1X average depth) covering 3 ka BC to 600 AD from across Eurasia. We show that around 3 ka BC, Central and Northern Europe and Central Asia receive genetic input through people related to the Yamnaya Culture from the Pontic-Caspian Steppe, resulting in the formation of the Corded Ware Culture in Europe and the Afanasievo Culture in Central Asia. A thousand years later, genetic input from North-Central Europe into Central Asia gives rise to the Sintashta and Andronovo Cultures. During the late BA and Iron Age, the European-derived populations in Asia are gradually replaced by multi-ethnic cultures, of which some relate to contemporary Asian groups, while others share recent ancestry with Native Americans. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesised spread of Indo-European languages during early BA and reveal that major parts of the demographic structure of present-day Eurasian populations were shaped during this period. We also demonstrate that light skin pigmentation in Europeans was already present at high frequency during the BA, contrary to lactose tolerance, indicating a more recent onset of positive selection in the latter than previously believed.

SRP052967	Metagenomes from human infant fecal samples with and without necrotizing enterocolitis	Premature infants are highly vulnerable to aberrant gastrointestinal tract colonization, a process that may lead to diseases like necrotizing enterocolitis. This study compares microbial communities of 10 co-hospitalized infants, five of which had a diagnosis of necrotizing enterocolitis.  Surprisingly, while potentially pathogenic bacteria of the same species colonized many infants, a genome-resolved analysis revealed that strains colonizing each baby were typically distinct. In particular, no strain was common to all infants that developed necrotizing enterocolitis. The paucity of shared gut colonizers suggests the existence of significant barriers to spread of bacteria among infants. Importantly, we demonstrate that strain-resolved comprehensive community analysis can be accomplished on potentially medically-relevant time scales.

SRP043535	Microbial consortium enriched at the cathode of a solar microbial fuel cell	The objective of this project is to study a microbial biocathode consortium enriched at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory's Center for Bio/Molecular Science & Engineering.  The initial inoculum for the solar microbial fuel cell was seawater collected near Rutgers, NJ, and the community has subsequently been maintained electroautotrophically via serial transfers on cathodes poised at 310 mV vs. SHE. This microbial consortium contains autotrophic organisms which can use a cathode as an electron donor and O2 as an electron acceptor, and has electrochemical properties potentially useful in bioenergy applications including microbial electrosynthesis and microbial fuel cell technology. System biology approaches will be used to identify functional genes that are relevant for bioenergy production, such as fixing CO2 as sole carbon source, electrosynthesis, O2 tolerance, etc.   Several heterotrophic constituents have been isolated in pure culture, and have been sequenced by either Illumina or PacBio technologies.  Furthermore, closed genomes and methylation data were obtained from PacBio sequencing of metagenomic DNA.    Metagenomic libraries generated from eight biological replicates of an enriched biocathode microbial community were sequenced at 2x100 base pairs (bp) (paired-end reads) using an Illumina HiSeq 2000. The reads were assembled using either IDBAUD or Ray.  The ideal k-mer length and node coverage were selected based on which gave results most similar to de novo sequencing of isolated bacterial cultures from the enriched community (Marinobacter sp. strain CP1 and Labrenzia sp. strain CP4).  Metatranscriptomic libraries were generated from four reactors inoculated with the same inoculum were grown at a set potential of 310 mV SHE until current density stabilized, cyclic voltammetry was recorded, and then two of them were set at a more positive potential (470 mV) and two remained at 310 mV for 48 hours before samples were harvested for RNA extraction.  This experiment was repeated with four more reactors inoculated with a new cell suspension from the same source electrode for a total of four biological replicates at each potential.

SRP006872	Alterations in the colon microbiota induced by the gastrointestinal nematode Trichuris suis	Helminth parasites have evolved to regulate host immunity to ensure their survival through mechanisms that dampen host inflammation. These properties have been recently exploited therapeutically to treat human diseases. The bio-complexity of the intestinal lumen would suggest that interactions between parasite and intestinal microbiota would also influence inflammation.  In this study, we characterized the porcine proximal colon microbiota in response to Trichuris suis (whipworm) infection using 16S rDNA-based and whole genome shotgun (WGS) approaches.  A 21-day T. suis infection in pigs induced a profound change in the composition of the proximal colon microbiota. The abundance of four of the 15 phyla identified, such as Proteobacteria, was changed in infected pigs. Approximately 10% of genera were significantly altered by infection. Notably, reduced Succinivibrio abundance in infected pigs implied that T. suis infection altered carbohydrate metabolism in the proximal colon microbial ecosystem. Conversely, Mucispirillum was significantly increased in infected pigs suggesting that mucosal disruption induced by parasitic infection and feeding perturbed this ecological niche. Infection led to a significant shift in the metabolic potential of the proximal colon microbiota. Approximately 26% of all metabolic pathways indentified were affected by infection. Two important functional categories repressed by infection were carbohydrate metabolism and lysine biosynthesis. Furthermore, changes in pathogen associated pathways suggested that T. suis infection could impact subsequent infection and modulate host-pathogen interactions. Our findings should facilitate development of strategies for parasitic control in pigs and humans and optimize successful helminth therapy to reduce inflammation.

SRP002150	viral metagenomics study of vaccine sample	Metagenomics and microarray technologies were used to examine eight live attenuated viral vaccines. Viral nucleic acids in trivalent oral poliovirus (OPV), rubella (Meruvax), measles (Attenuvax), yellow fever (YF Vax), human herpes 3 (Varivax), rotavirus (Rotarix and Rotateq) and multivalent Measles/Mumps/Rubella(MMR-II) live vaccines were randomly amplified and then pyrosequenced. Over half a million pyrosequence reads were generated covering from 20 to 99% of the attenuated viral genomes at a depth of up to 8000 reads per nucleotides. Mutations and minority variants were detected relative to previously reported vaccine strains in OPV, mumps virus, and varicella-zoster virus. The anticipated detection of endogeneous retroviral sequences from the producer avian or primate cells was confirmed. Avian leucosis virus (ALV), previously shown to be non-infectious for humans, was present as RNA in viral particles while simian retrovirus (SRV) was present as genetically defective DNA. An orally administered vaccine contained porcine circovirus-1, a highly prevalent pig virus, which has not been shown to be infectious in human. Hybridization of vaccine nucleic acids to a pan microbial microarray confirmed the presence of endogenous retroviral and PCV1 nucleic acids. Deep sequencing and microarrays can therefore detect attenuated virus sequence changes, minority variants, and adventitious viruses and help maintain the current safety record of live attenuated viral vaccines.

Some modern-day groupsâ€”specifically the Basquesâ€“have been argued to be a remnant population that connect back to the Paleolithic. We present the first genome-wide sequence data from eight individuals associated with archaeological remains from farming cultures in the El PortalÃ³n cave (Atapuerca, Spain). These individuals emerged from the same group of people as other Early European Farmers and they mixed with local hunter-gatherers on their way to Iberia. The El PortalÃ³n individuals showed the greatest genetic affinity to Basques, which suggests that Basques and their language may be linked with the spread of agriculture across Europe.

SRP053414	Entomopathogenic fungus on ant. Transcriptome or Gene expression	The fungus Pandora formicae (Entomophthoromycota) is an obligatory, biotrophic pathogen of wood ants. Ants get infected through fungal spores attaching to and penetrating the exoskeleton. Fungus then develops inside the hemocoel. After exploiting nutritional resources, the fungus induces a change in host behavior, manipulating the ant to climb up vegetation and die in an elevated position. This promotes effective disease transmission through actively discharged spores, produced by fungal conidiophores growing on the fixed cadaver. The goal of this project is to study genes expressed by a specialist entomopathogenic fungus during interaction with host, to gain insight about molecular mechanisms involved.	SRR1797627,SRR1825782

We will take a multidisciplinary approach to study changes in the structure and function of gut microbial communities in three sets of Old Order Amish patients from Lancaster Pennsylvania: obese patients, obese patients with metabolic syndrome and non-obese individuals. The Old Order Amish are a genetically closed homogeneous Caucasian population of Central European ancestry ideal for genetic studies. These works have the potential to provide new mechanistic insights into the role of gut microflora in obesity and metabolic syndrome, a disease that is responsible for significant morbidity in the adult population, and may ultimately lead to novel approaches for prevention and treatment of this disorder.

ERP017319	Metatranscriptomic Evidence for Direct Interspecies Electron Transfer Between Geobacter and Methanothrix Species in Rice Paddy Sediments	The possibility that Methanothrix (formerly Methanosaeata) and Geobacter species cooperate via direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET) in terrestrial methanogenic sediments was investigated in rice paddy soils. Genes with high homology to the gene for the PilA monomer of the electrically conductive pili (e-pili) of Geobacter sulfurreducens accounted for over half of the PilA gene sequences in metagenomic libraries and 37% of the mRNA transcripts in RNAseq libraries recovered from the paddy soils.This is significant because e-pili can serve as conduits for DIET. Most of the e-pili genes and transcripts were affiliated with Geobacter species, but sequences most closely related to putative e-pili genes from such genera as Desulfobacterium, Deferribacter, Geoalkalibacter, and Desulfobacula were also detected.  Analysis of metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequences indicated ca. 20% of the bacterial community was composed of Geobacter-like species and that Geobacter was actively transcribing the gene coding for citrate synthase (gltA), indicating that Geobacter were metabolically active in the soils. Mapping the metatranscriptome to the G. sulfurreducens genome demonstrated that e-pili genes were among the most highly transcribed Geobacter genes. In addition, homologs of genes coding for the c-type cytochrome OmcS, which is associated with the e-pili of G. sulfurreducens and also required for DIET, were also highly expressed in the soils. Methanothrix species in the sediments highly expressed genes for enzymes involved in the reduction of carbon dioxide to methane.  DIET is the only electron donor known to support carbon dioxide reduction in Methanothrix.  Thus, these results are consistent with a model in which Geobacter species were providing electrons to Methanothrix species for methane production through an e-pili electrical connection.

SRP028573	Integration site sequencing of silent/inducible and expressed HIV-1 proviruses	HIV infection can be treated effectively with antiretroviral agents, but the persistence of a latent reservoir of integrated proviruses prevents eradication of HIV from infected individuals. The chromosomal environment of integrated proviruses has been proposed to influence HIV latency, but the determinants of transcriptional repression have not been fully clarified, and it is unclear whether the same molecular mechanisms drive latency in different cell culture models. Here we compare data from five different in vitro models of latency based on primary human T cells or a T cell line. Cells were infected in vitro and separated into fractions containing proviruses that were either expressed or silent/inducible, and integration site populations sequenced from each. We compared the locations of 6,252 expressed proviruses to those of 6,184 silent/inducible proviruses with respect to 140 forms of genomic annotation, many analyzed over chromosomal intervals of multiple lengths. A regularized logistic regression model linking proviral expression status to genomic features revealed no predictors of latency that performed better than chance, though several genomic features were significantly associated with proviral expression in individual models. Proviruses in the same chromosomal region did tend to share the same expressed or silent/inducible status if they were from the same cell culture model, but not if they were from different models. The silent/inducible phenotype appears to be associated with chromosomal position, but the molecular basis is not fully clarified and may differ among in vitro models of latency.	SRR946778

SRP075412	Reconstruction of large genomic regions from single organisms and metagenomic samples	To overcome limitations related to genome reconstruction and to facilitate genomic diversity exploration of model and non-model organisms, we developed a target enrichment method for large genomic regions that could be applied to single organisms or metagenomic samples. Based on a hybridization capture strategy, this method allows for the enrichment of tens of kbp flanking a short, targeted DNA sequence. Due to the large DNA fragments captured, this innovative approach allows the resolution of complex genetic organization with the presence of repeats or genetic variations that are highly difficult to characterize using current molecular approaches. When applied to metagenomic samples, this approach enables the assignment of identity and function to micro-organisms in natural environments, one of the ultimate goals of microbial ecology.

ERP009736	The chromatin remodeling ATPases SNF2H and SNF2L position nucleosomes adjacent to CTCF and other transcription factors.	Within the genomes of metazoans, nucleosomes are highly organised adjacent to the binding sites for a subset of transcription factors. Here we have sought to investigate which chromatin remodelling enzymes are responsible for this. We find that the ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling enzyme SNF2H plays a major role organising arrays of nucleosomes adjacent to the binding sites for the architectural transcription factor CTCF sites and acts to promote CTCF binding. At many other factor binding sites SNF2H and the related enzyme SNF2L contribute to nucleosome organisation. The action of SNF2H at CTCF sites is functionally important as depletion of CTCF or SNF2H affects transcription of a common group of genes. This suggests that chromatin remodelling ATPaseâ€™s most closely related to the Drosophila ISWI protein contribute to the function of many human gene regulatory elements.

ERP003228	Impact of selective digestive decontamination on patient gut microbiome	To study the effect of antibiotic therapy during patient hospitalization on the antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) reservoir (â€˜the resistomeâ€™) formed by the human microbiota, conventional clinical culturing methods are insufficient. Here, we apply functional metagenomics (using large-insert fosmid libraries in Escherichia coli) and metagenomic shotgun sequencing to examine resistome dynamics in a patient admitted to an Intensive Care Unit, throughout hospital stay and nine months after hospital discharge. Our data indicate that selection for antibiotic resistance, specifically among anaerobic gut commensals, occurs during hospital stay. Functional metagenomics provided data on the genetic context of the resistance genes, which are frequently associated with putative mobile genetic elements. Metagenomic sequencing allowed the identification and relative quantification of many ARGs (between one and eleven for each antibiotic family) per sampled time-point. We suggest that metagenomic shotgun sequencing may be applied as a monitoring tool to detect and quantify ARGs in patient microbiota.	ERR281334,ERR281335,ERR281336,ERR281337,ERR281338

SRP056245	Deep subsurface microbial communities from Mt. Terri, Switzerland - Autotrophic microbial communities BRH/5 Metagenome	The subsurface biosphere is often cited to harbor vast microbial diversity and to represent a significant contribution to the planetâ€™s biomass. There is little understanding of the metabolic processes fueling these communities and the role of lithoautotrophic growth in nutrient cycling in the subsurface. H2 from geogenic sources such as serpentinization, radiolysis of water or hydrothermal fluid circulation is proposed as a fuel for microbial metabolism in deep subsurface environments where light dependent processes are limited to residual sedimentary carbon. The aim of this project is to identify the metabolic processes supported by H2 and characterize the lithoautotrophic microorganisms in the associated microbial community and to characterize the rate of consumption of H2 in these environments to account for microbial H2 consumption in their repository safety assessment models. To pursue these aims, we have built an underground in situ reactor that is delivering H2 to a borehole in the rock located at the Mt. Terri Underground Rock Laboratory in Switzerland that is instrumented to collect information continuously.We have been monitoring sulfate, sulfide, Fe(II), H2, CH4, organic acids, major cations and anions, alkalinity, borehole pressure as well as collecting samples for metagenomic analysis and for isotopic characterization (S, H and C).

ERP014771	Comparative metagenomics of microbial communities in gorgonian corals, marine sediments and seawater	The sustainability of coral reefs bears fundamental implications to the functioning of coastal ecosystems and the biogeochemistry of our planet. The coral-associated microbiota plays a pivotal role as a fitness-enhancing factor in the survivability and persistence of the coral holobiont in marine biomes. Nevertheless, we currently lack knowledge of the taxonomy and functional traits of the highly complex microbiome that populates most coral species. Conspicuously, symbionts inhabiting soft corals which usually thrive and dominate in temperate waters have been scarcely examined.  In this study, we employ a comparative metagenomics approach to uncover the distinct phylogenetic and functional features of the microbiome of soft corals. To this end, high-throughput, Illumina metagenome sequencing of seawater, sediments and of the symbiotic consortium from the gorgonian corals Eunicella verrucosa, Eunicella gazella and Leptogorgia sarmentosa was performed.

ERP013092	Intestinal microbiome is related to lifetime antibiotic use in Finnish pre-school children	Early-life antibiotic use is associated with increased risk for metabolic and immunological diseases, and mouse studies indicate a causal role of the disrupted microbiome. However, little is known about the impacts of antibiotics on the developing microbiome of children. Here we use phylogenetics, metagenomics and individual antibiotic purchase records to show that macrolide use in 2-7 year old Finnish children (N=142; sampled at two time points) is associated with a long-lasting shift in  microbiota composition and metabolism. The shift includes depletion of Actinobacteria, increase in Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria, decrease in bile-salt hydrolase, and increase in macrolide resistance. Furthermore, macrolide use in early life is associated with increased risk of asthma and predisposes to antibiotic-associated weight gain. Overweight and asthmatic children have distinct microbiota compositions. Penicillins leave a weaker mark on the microbiota than macrolides. Our results support the idea that, without compromising clinical practice, the impact on the intestinal microbiota should be considered when prescribing antibiotics. Penicillins leave a weaker mark on the microbiota than macrolides.

Microbial communities resident on hostsâ€™ skin show topographical and temporal diversity mapping to physical and biotic features of the skin ecosystem but studies have mainly focussed on the human microbiome. We examined skin microbiomes of fire-bellied toads (Bombina orientalis) to determine whether microbial community varies between the dorsal and the ventral skin region, more prone to Bd infection. We also assessed whether topographical variations were more pronounced in captive than in wild populations.	SRR1745259,SRR1745260

SRP050217	A Fungal Signature in the Gut Microbiota of Pediatric Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease	Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) involves dysregulation of mucosal immunity in response to environmental factors such as the gut microbiota. The bacterial microbiota is altered in IBD, but the connection to disease is not fully clarified. Evidence suggests that gut fungi may play a role in the pathogenesis of IBD. In this study, we compared all three domains of life, bacteria, archaea, and eukaryote, in patients with IBD to healthy human subjects. A stool sample was collected from pediatric patients with IBD, and bacterial, archaeal, and fungal community structures were characterized by deep sequencing of rRNA gene segments. The results were compared to results from a cohort of pediatric and adult control subjects. IBD patients (Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis) had lower bacterial diversity. ITS1 tagged-sequencing was used to detect fungi and showed a distinct separation between IBD patients and healthy controls. Two sequences annotating as Candida (OTUs GU370744  and EF197997) were significantly more abundant in IBD patients (p = 0.0034 and p= 0.00038, respectively) while a different Candida taxon (OTU EU490138) was more abundant in healthy subjects (p= 0.0025).  There were no statistically significant differences in archaea, which were rare in pediatric samples compared to adults. Pediatric IBD is associated with reduced diversity in both fungal and bacterial gut microbiota. Specific Candida taxa were increased in abundance in the IBD samples.  These data emphasize the potential importance of fungal microbiota signatures as a useful biomarker of pediatric IBD, supporting their possible role in disease pathogenesis.

We used 18S rRNA gene sequencing to provide the first snapshot of pelagic microeukaryotic community structure in two cellular size fractions (0.2â€“1.6Âµm, >1.6Âµm) from seven depths through the anoxic oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) off northern Chile. These data, compared to those from other low-oxygen sites, reveals variation in OMZ microeukaryote composition, helping to identify clades with potential adaptations to oxygen-depletion.	SRR1640275

ERP016546	Composition_of_the_human_micobiome_in_granulomatosis_with_polyangiitis__A_pilot_study	Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) is an autoimmune disease associated with antineutrophil cytoplasm antibodies and arises from dysregulated immune responses in the respiratory epithelium. Geographic associations point to an environmental cause in patients with an appropriate immunogenetic predisposition.  The human microbiome exhibits a rich, dynamic, complex, and individual-specific interaction with the individual. Thus, this study will elucidate the role of nasal colonisation in GPA by microbiome analysis. This will yield a detailed analysis of the nasal microbiota obtained from patients in three different disease states. The initial investigation under the Project will include patients with (i) new-onset of disease or at relapse; (ii) patients in â€˜on drugâ€™ remission still on immunosuppressive medication; and (iii) patients in stable â€˜off drugâ€™ remission with no ongoing immunomodulatory therapy.

SRP076119	Human fecal microbiome before and after consumption of AH1206 - Raw sequence reads	Live bacteria have been used for decades in an attempt to modulate the human gut microbiota, but their colonization is mostly transient, and a conceptual understanding of the ecological role of exogenous microbes in gut ecosystems is lacking. Here we show that Bifidobacterium longum AH1206 stably persists in the gut of one third of human individuals for at least six months after being orally administered without causing gastrointestinal symptoms or impacting the composition of the resident gut microbiota. Engraftment of AH1206 was associated with low abundance of B. longum and specific carbohydrate utilization genes of this species in the pre-treatment microbiome. This pointed to inter-individual differences in the availability of resources that constitute a niche opportunity for colonization. The findings suggest that bacterial species and functional genes absent in the gut microbiome of individual humans can be reestablished, providing opportunities for precision microbiome reconstitution and a personalization of such strategies.

Prior to the experiments, LN field has not been subjected to N fertilization for consecutive 5 years. Soil DNA of each paddy field was also extracted.  The reduction of fertilizer usage is one of the preferable field managements to attain sustainable agriculture. Herein, we applied metagenomic analysis to rice root-associated microbiome to understand microbial community shifts in paddy rice field ecosystems under different N fertilizer regimes. Rice plants were cultivated in paddy fields dressed with low N (LN; 0 kg ha-1), standard N (SN; 30 kg ha-1). Our analysis revealed that low input of N fertilizer drastically changed the functionalities of rice root-associated microbes relevant to N2 fixation, plant hormonal effect and methane cycling.

ERP018621	Identification of bacterial pathogens and antimicrobial resistance directly from clinical urines by nanopore-based metagenomic sequencing.	The introduction of metagenomic sequencing to diagnostic microbiology has been hampered by slowness, cost and complexity. We explored whether MinION nanopore sequencing could accelerate diagnosis and resistance profiling, using complicated urinary tract infections as an exemplar.  Bacterial DNA was enriched from clinical urines (n?=?10) and from healthy urines 'spiked' with multiresistant Escherichia coli (n?=?5), then sequenced by MinION. Sequences were analysed using external databases and bioinformatic pipelines or, ultimately, using integrated real-time analysis applications. Results were compared with Illumina data and resistance phenotypes.  MinION correctly identified pathogens without culture and, among 55 acquired resistance genes detected in the cultivated bacteria by Illumina sequencing, 51 were found by MinION sequencing directly from the urines; with three of the four failures in an early run with low genome coverage. Resistance-conferring mutations and allelic variants were not reliably identified.  MinION sequencing comprehensively identified pathogens and acquired resistance genes from urine in a timeframe similar to PCR (4 h from sample to result). Metagenomic-sequencing-based diagnosis will enable clinicians to adjust antimicrobial therapy before the second dose of a typical (i.e. every 8 h) antibiotic.

ERP023064	Strain-level metagenomic analysis of the fermented dairy beverage nunu highlights potential food safety risks	The rapid detection of pathogenic strains in food products is essential for the prevention of disease outbreaks. It has already been demonstrated that whole metagenome shotgun sequencing can be used to detect pathogens in food but, until recently, strain-level detection of pathogens has relied on whole metagenome assembly, which is a computationally demanding process. Here, we demonstrate that three short read alignment-based methods , MetaMLST, PanPhlAn, and StrainPhlAn, can accurately, and rapidly, identify pathogenic strains in spinach metagenomes which were intentionally spiked  with Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli in a previous study. Subsequently, we employ the methods, in combination with other metagenomics approaches, to assess the safety of nunu, a traditional Ghanaian fermented milk product which is produced by the spontaneous fermentation of raw cow milk. We show that nunu samples are frequently contaminated with  bacteria associated with the bovine gut, and worryingly, we detect putatively pathogenic E. coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae strains in a subset of nunu samples. Ultimately, our work establishes that short read alignment-based bioinformatics approaches are suitable food safety tools, and we describe a real-life example of their utilisation.

SRP095580	Gut microbial interactions with the inflammatory cytokine production capacity	As part of the 500 Functional Genomics (500FG) project, stool samples from 471 healthy adults were subjected to metagenomic shotgun sequencing (one time point per individual). Concurrently, blood samples were collected from each individual and the cytokine production was measured in response to bacterial and fungal stimulations.

ERP019484	Metagenomic Analysis of Dairy Bacteriophages: Extraction Method and Pilot Study on Whey Samples Derived from Using Undefined and Defined Mesophilic Starter Cultures	Despite their huge potential for characterizing the biodiversity of phages, metagenomic studies are currently not available for dairy bacteriophages, partly due to the lack of a standard procedure for phage extraction. We optimized an extraction method that allows to remove the bulk protein from whey and milk samples with losses of less than 50% of spiked phages. The protocol was applied to extract phages from whey in order to test the notion that members of Lactococcus (Lc.) lactis 936 (now Sk1virus), P335, c2 (now C2virus) and Leuconostoc phage groups are the most frequently encountered in the dairy environment. The relative abundance and diversity of phages in eight and four whey mixtures from dairies using undefined mesophilic mixed-strain DL-starter cultures and defined cultures, respectively, was assessed. Results obtained from transmission electron microscopy and high-throughput sequence analyses revealed the dominance of Lc. lactis 936 phages (order Caudovirales, family Siphoviridae) in dairies using undefined DL-starter cultures and Lc. lactis c2 phages (order Caudovirales, family Siphoviridae) in dairies using defined cultures. The 936 and Leuconostoc phages demonstrated limited diversity. Possible co-induction of temperate P335 prophages and satellite phages in one of the whey mixtures was also observed.

ERP022699	Compositional_dynamics_of_intestinal_spore_forming_bacteria	We believe spore forming bacteria could play a key role in maintaining the integrity of the intestinal microbiota. Transmission of spore-formers could help promote a high level of diversity within the intestinal microbiota. In addition, due to their robust nature, spore formers could also provide a means of resilience when the community is challenged. To investigate the role of intestinal spore forming bacteria in the microbiota we wish to perform metagenomic sequencing of the microbiota obtained from faecal samples from 6 healthy human donors. By comparing the data generated with previously generated data from the same donors we can start to understand the dynamics of the spore forming bacteria over time.

ERP003911	community genomics of hot-springs at manikaran	Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus is a small bacterial predator that can invade, kill and assimilate its microbial prey. While B. bacteriovorus has been characterised from mesophilic environments (soil, marine and freshwater, etc.) these communities are not ammenable to metagenomic re-assembly of predatory and prey genotypes due to high taxonomic diversity and community eveness. Here we present the first metagenomic analysis of the microbial mats of an arsenic rich (140ppb) hot spring (surface temperature > 90 Â°C) in which the predator-prey genotypes were characterized. The microbial mats were enriched with Bdellovibrio and several Gram negative bacteria including Bordetella (16%), Enterobacter (6.8%), Burkoldria (4.8%), Acinitobacter (2.3%), and Yersinia (1%). A high quality (51 contigs, 25X coverage; 3.5Mbp) draft genome of B. bacteriovoras (strain â€˜Metaâ€™) was reasembled, which lacked two genes associatd with the established method of prey interaction and invaision, but still contained genes coding for the hydrolytic enzymes necessary for prey assimilation. Using predation experiments, a predatory B. bacteriovoras was identified that manifest a novel mode of predation via flagella supported side-on prey contact, without cellular invasion. Furthermore, a draft pangenome of the dominant host taxon, Enterobacter cloacae sub. sp, (4.8Mb), along with 2 of its viral genotypes (n=2; 42 and 50kb) was assembled. Viral predation and mainatnce of strain specificity in E. cloacae was confirmed by the presence of CRISPERs. These data were used to construct a theoretical model describing potential predator avoidance strategies, whereby the E. cloacae strains can move between anaerobic and aerobic niches by quroum sensing population size, which is modulated by a â€˜kill the winnerâ€™ viral mechanism, and predation by the obligate aerobe, B. bacteriovoras.

SRP043213	Ecological Genomics of a Seasonally Anoxic Fjord; Saanich Inlet	Saanich Inlet is a seasonally anoxic fjord opening to the Strait of Georgia on the southeast coast of Vancouver Island, British Columbia. It is approximately 24 kilometers long with a maximal basin depth of 234 meters and receives limited freshwater input from the surrounding watershed. A shallow glacial entrance sill 75 meters deep restricts circulation within interior and basin waters for most of the year. During spring and summer months, restricted circulation combined with high levels of primary productivity in surface waters lead to oxygen loss with concomitant water column stratification indicated by accumulation of methane (CH4), Ammonia (NH3) and Hydrogen Sulfide (H2S). In late summer and fall, oxygenated nutrient-rich ocean waters upwelling through the Strait cascade into Saanich Inlet shoaling anoxic bottom waters upward and transforming the redox chemistry of the water column. This process is stable on decadal time scales exhibiting a relatively narrow deviation in the depth distribution of the oxycline at different times of year. The recurring seasonal development of water column anoxia followed by deep-water renewal enables spatiotemporal profiling of microbial community structure and function across a wide range of water column redox states.

SRP090393	Chesapeake Bay Virioplankton Metagenome	Virioplankton shotgun metagenome from Chesapeake Bay water sample collected at the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center in Edgewater, Maryland. The sample was deeply sequenced using 77 million paired-end 150 bp Illumina reads and 350,000 long single-molecule PacBio reads averaging 1,700 bp in length. Objectives of the study were to evaluate the utility of single-molecule real time (SMRT) PacBio sequencing for metagenomics and to deeply sample virioplankton diversity. Hybrid assembly of short (Illumina) and long (PacBio) read sequence data showed substantial improvements in the yield of genome-length high quality contigs from the viral metagenome. Specifically, the assembly yielded 1,079 contigs greater than 20 kb, 62 of which were circular and likely complete dsDNA viral genomes. Phylogenetic analysis of the long viral contigs provided a high-resolution view of previously unknown viral diversity that was unattainable through either technology alone. Additionally, sequencing of marker gene PCR amplicons (using PacBio SMRT circular consensus protocol) was utilized to examine the depth of shotgun metagenome sampling.

SRP029388	Metagenomic Analysis of Size-fractionated Picoplankton in a Marine Oxygen Minimum Zone	This study explores the genetic and metabolic diversity of microorganisms (Bacteria and Archaea) in a marine oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) off of northern Chile. Microbial metabolism in OMZs contributes to large scale biogeochemical cycles, notably the marine nitrogen cycle. However, the identity of the microorgansims mediating these cycles is largely unexplored. The ecological factors controlling the distribution and activity of OMZ microbes are also largely unknown. Metagenomes generated in this study provide knowledge of the diversity and function of OMZ microbes across depth gradients. Metagenomes were also collected from distinct microbial size fractions, enabling a comparison of free-living and particle-attached microbial communities. This comparison helps identify key functional properties distinguishing microbial life history strategies in the ocean.

SRP107814	Spirulina Raw sequence reads	Cas1 integrase is the key enzyme of the CRISPR-Cas adaptation module that mediates acquisition of spacers derived from foreign DNA into the CRISPR arrays. In a diverse set of bacteria, Cas1 is fused to a reverse transcriptase (RT) domain that is related to the RTs of Group II introns and enables acquisition of CRISPR spacers from RNA. To compare the sequence pools sampled by RT-Cas1-associated and RT-lacking CRISPR-Cas systems, we obtained a series of independent samples from a cyanobacterial species Arthrospira platensis, grown commercially in open-air â€˜racewayâ€™ ponds. Sequencing of the CRISPR spacer repertoire as well as the intracellular and extracellular DNA and RNA pools uncovered a highly diverse population of spacers. However, the principal source(s) of the spacers, particularly the hyper-variable spacer repertoire of the RT-associated arrays, remains enigmatic.

SRP048732	Ammonia monooxygenase biogeography and sequence diversity in the Cape Fear Estuary	This project is focused on exploring the spatial and temporal distribution of microbes involved in nitrification within the sediments of the Cape Fear Estuary. 454 Sequencing of both bacterial and archaeal amoA genes was conducted with DNA extracts obtained from estaurine surface sediment samples. Spatial patterns were evaluated by collecting sediment along the salinity gradient of the estuary. Temporal patterns were evaluated by collecting sediment samples seasonal over a three year period. The interaction of community composition with environmental conditions was evaluated using in situ sediment transplant experiments within the estuary, where sediment bundles were moved from one location in the estuary to another and changes in the microbial community were observed over time following transplantation. These data are relevant to understanding the diversity and distribution of microbes involved in microbial nitrogen cycling and how the diversity of these functional groups interact with environmental conditions within an estuary.

ERP010597	Sialylated milk glycans promote growth in gnotobiotic mice and pigs with a stunted Malawian infant gut microbiota	Identifying interventions that more effectively promote healthy growth of children with undernutrition is a pressing global health goal. Analysis of human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) from 6-month postpartum mothers in two Malawian birth-cohorts revealed that sialylated HMOs are significantly less abundant in mothers with severely stunted infants. To explore this association, we colonized young germ-free mice with a consortium of bacterial strains cultured from the fecal microbiota of a 6-month old stunted Malawian infant and fed recipient animals a prototypic Malawian diet with or without purified sialylated bovine milk oligosaccharides (S-BMO). S-BMO produced a microbiota-dependent augmentation of lean body mass gain, changed bone morphology and altered liver, muscle and brain metabolism in ways indicative of a greater ability to utilize nutrients for anabolism.

ERP001726	Reconstructing ancestral genotype from environmental genomes and                 metagenomes	Earth crust contains estimated 600,000 tons of hexachlorocycloheane                 (HCH), nearly half of the terrestrial organochlorine pesticide. Using paired end                 sequenced (~100X) genome and HCH dumpsite metagenome (~1.6Gbp) data we have                 reconstructed the last common ancestor (3128 genes) of two representative HCH                 degrading subspecies (average nucleotide identity = >98%); Sphingobium indicum B90A                 and Sphingobium japonicum UT26. We find metagenomic evidences of large scale                 horizontal gene transfer (> 20%) in the subspecies, unexpectedly; lindane                 degradation upper pathway (linA, linB and linC) as transposon mediated genetic                 import. Anthranilate degradation is a strain specific trait for Sphingobium                 japonicum UT26; acquired from the ancestor but absent in its subspecies and lineages                 in situ. In contrast, homogentisate degradation is an environment specific trait as                 itâ€™s absent in the predicted ancestor and subspecies but fairly present across                 dumpsite microbiota. Cross validated (replicates) dumpsite metagenome showed                 enrichment for genotypes (strains) of the genus Sphingobium. Using tetraESOM and                 graph based clustering on genome and metagenome sequence data, we have reassembled                 one draft secondary chromosome, 2 near complete plasmids and 8 complete transposons                 (corresponding to lin genes; IS6 family-IS6100) enriched at dumpsite. Reconstructed,                 pangenomic structural variants were validated in situ (coverage ~13X). Together, our                 results reveals yet unknown evolutionary dynamics of the specialised (xenobiotic                 degradation) genus, at one of the worldâ€™s most polluted HCH open sink.

ERP002477	A metagenomics transect into the deepest point of the Baltic Sea reveals clear stratification of microbial functional capacities	The Baltic Sea is characterized by hyposaline surface waters, hypoxic and anoxic deep waters and sediments. These conditions, which in turn lead to a steep oxygen gradient, are particularly evident at Landsort Deep in the Baltic Proper. Given these substantial differences in environmental parameters at Landsort Deep, we performed a metagenomic census spanning surface to sediment to establish whether the microbial communities at this site are as stratified as the physical environment. We report strong stratification across a depth transect for both functional capacity and taxonomic affiliation, with functional capacity corresponding most closely to key environmental parameters of oxygen, salinity and temperature. We report similarities in functional capacity between the hypoxic community and hadal zone communities, underscoring the substantial degree of eutrophication in the Baltic Proper. Reconstruction of the nitrogen cycle at Landsort deep shows potential for syntrophy between archaeal ammonium oxidizers and bacterial denitrification at anoxic depths, while anaerobic ammonium oxidation genes are absent, despite substantial ammonium levels below the chemocline. Our census also reveals enrichment in genetic prerequisites for a copiotrophic lifestyle and resistance mechanisms reflecting adaptation to prevalent eutrophic conditions and the accumulation of environmental pollutants resulting from ongoing anthropogenic pressures in the Baltic Sea.

Genome reads from one cell were dominated by a novel DNA nanovirus widespread in the worldâ€™s oceans. A significant fraction of DNA sequences from the other two cells was derived from marine Bacteroidetes and large DNA viruses, likely protist food sources. Our work uncovered remarkably dynamic biotic interactions among marine microorganisms without biases introduced by cultivation.	SRR068243,SRR068244,SRR068245

SRP029257	Dental Calculus Metagenome (archaeological)	The purpose of this study was to investigate oral microbiome, dietary, and host DNA in archaeological human dental calculus (mineralized dental plaque), dentine, and bone using shotgun metagenomics and targeted 16S rRNA deep sequencing approaches. The samples in this study were obtained from four skeletons (G12, B17, B61, and B78) from the medieval site of Dalheim, Germany (ca. AD 950-1200). The skeletons exhibited osteological evidence of periodontal disease. A total of nine indexed Illumina shotgun metagenomic libraries were prepared from B61 and G12 dental calculus using different extraction and decontamination protocols. The nine indexed libraries were pooled and sequenced on a single Illumina HiSeq 2000 lane. A total of 32 indexed 454 targeted 16S rRNA libraries (V3, V5, and V6 regions) were prepared from paired dental calculus and dentine samples from G12, B17, B61, and B78, as well as from carious dentine and abscessed bone from B17. The 32 indexed libraries were pooled and sequenced on a 454 GS Junior. The genetic data associated with this project (including contig assemblies) are also available at MG-RAST in Project 365: http://metagenomics.anl.gov/linkin.cgi?project=365.

SRP029217	Fig and fig wasp mutualism	In this study, we sequenced the mRNA of F. obtusifolia flowers and all other eukaryotic organisms present within the flower tissue, creating a metatranscriptome of the fig and fig wasp mutualism. We compared metatranscriptomes of seed and gall flowers in figs harvested before and after entrance by fig wasps to determine (1) biochemical and metabolic differences between these two flower types that may influence oviposition by wasps, and (2) gene expression of both plant and wasp at the beginning of gall development. These two elements (oviposition choice and galling), which are essential to the fig and fig wasp interaction, may provide clues to the evolutionary origin and stability of this ancient and classic mutualism.

SRP049252	Deep igneous marine biosphere Metagenome	To determine the role of mineralogy and composition on the microbial ecology of the deep igneous marine biosphere, we incubated twelve igneous minerals and glasses in IODP Hole 1301A on the eastern flank of the Juan de Fuca Ridge (47Â° 45.210' N, 127Â° 45.833' W) for four years (2004 â€“ 2008) (Smith et al., 2011). Hole 1301A is a subseafloor microbial observatory equipped with a Circulation Obviation Retrofit Kit (CORK) that allowed us to suspend microbial flow cells 262 m within the basalt basement, exposing common igneous minerals and glasses to the aquifer community. Pyrotag sequencing revealed that the mineral olivine was dominated by the uncultured, and thus uncharacterized, archaeum Archaeoglobaceae OTU 5. The low complexity of the microbial community associated with olivine makes this an ideal candidate for shotgun metagenomic sequencing, with the explicit goal of reconstructing the metagenomes of members of the Archaeoglobaceae. Given that olivine is one of the most abundant minerals in oceanic crust, understanding the functional role of the uncultured Archaeoglobaceae in biogeochemical cycling in the marine subsurface is imperative and has the potential to provide transformative knowledge regarding mineral weathering on a global scale. We predict that Archaeoglobaceae OTU 5 is using either an iron-based or hydrogen-based metabolism on olivine surfaces, and it may be a major primary producer in olivine-rich crust.

NGS of genomic DNA was used to identify putative centromeric repeats, while RNAseq allowed us to identify and characterize the CENH3 gene of Rhynchospora pubera, our model species. An antibody recognizing the holocentromeres of that species was then designed. ChIP-seq was used to validate the association of the centromeric repeat candidates, a satellite DNA (Tyba) and a centromeric retrotransposon (CRRh), to the functional centromeric nucleosomes from a holocentric species. Finally, assembly of sequenced BACs containing Tyba centromeric tandem repeat was used to examine the properties of the multiple centromeric units found.

ERP009042	Transcriptomics of two evolutionary novelties: sword and gonopodium	Swords are exaggerated male ornaments of swordtail fishes that have been of great interest to evolutionary biologists ever since Darwin described them in the Descent of Man (1871). They are a novel sexually selected trait derived from modified ventral caudal fin rays and are only found in the genus Xiphophorus. Another phylogenetically widespread and older male trait is the gonopodium, an intromittent organ found in all poeciliid fishes, that is derived from a modified anal fin. Despite many evolutionary and behavioral studies on both traits, little is known so far about the molecular mechanisms underlying their development. By investigating transcriptomic changes (utilizing a RNA-Seq approach) in response to testosterone treatment in the swordtail fish, Xiphophorus hellerii, we aimed to better understand the architecture of the gene regulatory networks underpinning the development of these two evolutionary novelties. Large numbers of genes with tissue-specific expression patterns were identified. Among the â€œsword genesâ€ those involved in embryonic organ development, sexual character development and coloration were highly expressed, while in the gonopodium rather more morphogenesis-related genes were found. Interestingly, many genes and genetic pathways are shared between both developing novel traits derived from median fins: the sword and the gonopodium. Our analyses show that a larger set of gene networks was co-opted during the development and evolution of the â€˜olderâ€™ gonopodium than in the â€˜youngerâ€™, and morphologically less complex trait, the sword. We provide a catalogue of candidate genes for future efforts to dissect the development of those sexually-selected exaggerated male traits in swordtails.	ERR705758

SRP115721	Intermittent Fasting Promotes White Adipose Browning and Decreases Obesity via Shaping the Gut Microbiota	While activation of beige thermogenesis is a promising approach for treatment of obesity-associated diseases, there are currently no known pharmacological means to induce beiging in humans. Intermittent fasting is an effective and natural strategy for weight control, but the mechanism for its efficacy is poorly understood. Here, we show that an every other day fasting (EODF) regimen selectively stimulates beige fat development within white adipose tissue, and dramatically ameliorates obesity, insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis. EODF treatment results in a shift in the gut microbiota composition leading to the elevation of the fermentation products acetate and lactate, and the selective upregulation of monocarboxylate transporter 1 expression in beige cells. Microbiota-depleted mice are resistance to EODF-induced beiging, while transplantation of the microbiota from EODF-treated mice to microbiota-depleted mice activates beiging and improves metabolic homeostasis. These findings provide a new gut microbiota-driven mechanism for activating adipose tissue browning and treating metabolic diseases.

ERP001477	Metagenomics of the gill chamber epibiosis of deep-sea shrimp Rimicaris                 exoculata and discovery of zetaproteobacterial epibionts	The shrimp Rimicaris exoculata flourishes on deep-sea hydrothermal                 chimneys along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR). This species harbors dense community of                 chemoautotrophic epibiotic bacteria associated with mineral oxide deposits in its                 enlarged gill chamber. We used metagenomics on specimens from the Rainbow                 hydrothermal vent site, to investigate the metabolism of the two main                 sulfur-oxidizing epibionts affiliated to the Epsilonproteobacteria and                 Gammaproteobacteria. Both epibionts had genes of the Sox pathway for sulfur                 oxidation and hydrogenases. In the epsilonproteobacterial epibiont, two distinct                 denitrification systems (Nas/Nir and Nap/Nrf) as well as a complete rTCA cycle for                 carbon dioxide fixation were found, while the gammaproteobacterial epibiont was                 found to fix carbon dioxide via the CBB cycle with RuBisCo form II. The shrimp gill                 chamber metagenome provided information on host-epibiont interactions, like on                 virulence gene homologues and genes for surface attachment. Likewise, genes were                 found that might play a role in host nutritional and detoxification processes, and                 thus are of major importance for the survival of the shrimp and its adaptation to                 the hydrothermal vent environment. Interestingly, analysis of the metagenome                 revealed sequences affiliated to the iron-oxidizing class Zetaproteobacteria, which                 would explain gill chamber iron oxyhydroxide deposits. Presence of                 Zetaproteobacteria was confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridizations and thereby                 provided first evidence for a Zetaproteobacteria-invertebrate                 association.

SRP060287	Oxygen-depleated ocean water microbiome	The eastern tropical North Atlantic (ETNA) is characterized by a highly productive coastal upwelling system and a moderate oxygen minimum zone with lowest open ocean oxygen (O2) concentrations of around 40 Âµmol kg-1. The recent discovery of reoccurring mesoscale eddies with exceptionally low O2 concentrations (<1 Âµmol kg-1) just below the mixed layer challenged our understanding of biogeochemical processes in this area. Here, we present the first metagenomic dataset from a deoxygenated anticyclonic modewater eddy in the open waters of the ETNA. We observed a significantly lower bacterial diversity in the eddy compared to surrounding waters, along with a marked community shift. We detected enhanced primary productivity in the surface layer of the eddy indicated by elevated chlorophyll concentrations and increased carbon uptake rates up to three times as high as in surrounding waters. Carbon uptake correlated to the presence of a specific high-light ecotype of Prochlorococcus, which is usually underrepresented in the ETNA. Our data indicate that high primary production in the eddy fuels export production and a microbial community responsible for enhanced respiration at intermediate depth. Progressively decreasing O2 concentrations in the eddy promote even denitrification in the O2-depleted core waters, a process usually absent from the open ETNA waters. This is supported by the qPCR analysis of nirS as key gene for denitrification in that area show unexpected high abundances inside the eddy, with ~3000 copies L-1 at the O2 minimum (~100 m) more than one order higher than outside the eddy (~100 copies L-1). As current studies suggest that these eddies occur more frequently than previously expected, respiration, accompanying acidification and potential fixed nitrogen loss may severely impact surrounding waters.

SRP056250	Deep subsurface microbial communities from Mt. Terri, Switzerland - Autotrophic microbial communities BRH/21 Metagenome	The subsurface biosphere is often cited to harbor vast microbial diversity and to represent a significant contribution to the planetâ€™s biomass. There is little understanding of the metabolic processes fueling these communities and the role of lithoautotrophic growth in nutrient cycling in the subsurface. H2 from geogenic sources such as serpentinization, radiolysis of water or hydrothermal fluid circulation is proposed as a fuel for microbial metabolism in deep subsurface environments where light dependent processes are limited to residual sedimentary carbon. The aim of this project is to identify the metabolic processes supported by H2 and characterize the lithoautotrophic microorganisms in the associated microbial community and to characterize the rate of consumption of H2 in these environments to account for microbial H2 consumption in their repository safety assessment models. To pursue these aims, we have built an underground in situ reactor that is delivering H2 to a borehole in the rock located at the Mt. Terri Underground Rock Laboratory in Switzerland that is instrumented to collect information continuously.We have been monitoring sulfate, sulfide, Fe(II), H2, CH4, organic acids, major cations and anions, alkalinity, borehole pressure as well as collecting samples for metagenomic analysis and for isotopic characterization (S, H and C).

SRP032651	UluPandan WasteWater Sludge Metagenome	The establishment of industrial-scale, clean water technologies in the mid-late 19th century caused a notable reduction (~15%) in disease-related mortality. However, exponential human population growth over the last 50 years has created severe additional challenges, including deteriorating fresh and marine water environments, which are the primary recipients of wastewater discharges. Increasingly complex contemporary requirements for environmental regulation, energy efficiency, enhanced nutrient and water recovery, public health risk management, and urban sustainability necessitate better understanding and control of the key biological processes that drive current and future clean water technologies. While insights into the microbiological make-up of the functional community of these critical bioprocesses have started to emerge, a greatly enhanced understanding of the mechanisms by which floccular biofilm communities perform specific transformations, including the degradation of complex organic materials and sequestration of nutrients is still required.

SRP059841	watershed biome Raw sequence reads	Water quality is currently assessed primarily at the tap using culture-based indicators of microbial pollution, such as coliform bacteria and E. coli. This paradigm is restrictive because it relies on century-old technologies and does not consider the broader impact of microbial pollution on the larger ecosystem. Furthermore, this approach enables only reactive responses focused on human health rather than proactive measures that protect water at its source: the watershed.Our goal is to change the way we monitor water quality in our watersheds. Advances in genomic technology have enabled us to broadly study the microbial community composition of watersheds and to understand how this community changes in response to environmental perturbations. By broadly surveying the microbial community in our watersheds we intend to discover novel microbial indicators associated with polluted versus healthy watersheds. Our study has three principal goals:1) To use metagenomics to measure the impact of pollution on the bacterial communities in different watersheds.2) To use amplicon sequencing of various microbial genes including the 16S and 18S rRNA and gp23 genes to quantify the microbiome, which consist of viruses, bacteria, and small eukaryotes (which include protists and fungi), of different watersheds.3) To create novel tests that monitor these microbial community changes in order to detect pollution and pinpoint the specific source of the pollution.By creating new tests that focus on overall watershed health, as opposed to just human health, we will provide the advanced tools needed to protect our watersheds.

SRP060506	Pasteurellaceae bacterium NI1060 Genome sequencing	NI1060 is a murine bacterial pathobiont responsible for Nod1-dependent induction of periodontitis. To better understand its pathogenicity, we have fully sequenced its genome. We found genes encoding putative virulence factors including specific lipooligosaccharides, adhesins and bacteriotoxic proteins. These genes are potentially important for host adaption and for the induction of dysbiosis through bacterial competition and pathogenicity. Importantly, NI1060 possesses frameshift mutations in two genes that are important for peptidoglycan recycling. In addition, NI1060 is a novel species of the Pasteurellaceae family, closely related to P. pneumotropica, containing metabolic pathways that support growth from unique energy sources.

SRP059613	Hot Lake Unicyanobacterial Consortia	Microbial autotroph-heterotroph interactions influence biogeochemical cycles on a global scale, but the diversity and complexity of natural systems and their intractability to in situ manipulation make it challenging to elucidate the principles governing these interactions. We have cultured several unicyanobacterial consortia from the microbial mat in Hot Lake, Washington. These communities are stable to serial passage. They provide experimentally manipulable systems of tractable complexity. A multi-omics approach is being used to determine the composition of the consortia and the fundamental and realized niches of each component species under conditions representing the extremes of environmental conditions experienced in situ. This will allow us to investigate the functional dynamics within the communities as a function of environment.	SRR2069879,SRR2069893

SRP057522	Snake arenavirus genetic diversity	Arenaviruses represent the largest family of human hemorrhagic fever viruses and are known to infect both mammals and snakes. Arenaviruses package a large (L) and small (S) genome segment in their virions. For segmented RNA viruses like these, novel genotypes can be generated through mutation, recombination, and reassortment. Although it is believed that an ancient recombination event led to the emergence of a new lineage of mammalian arenaviruses, neither recombination nor reassortment has been definitively documented in natural arenavirus infections. Here, we used metagenomic sequencing to survey the viral diversity present in captive arenavirus-infected snakes. From 48 infected animals, we determined the complete or near complete sequence of 210 genome segments that grouped into 23 L and 11 S genotypes. The majority of snakes were multiply infected, with up to 4 distinct S and 11 distinct L segment genotypes in individual animals. This S/L imbalance was typical: in all cases intrahost L segment genotypes outnumbered S genotypes, and a particular S segment genotype dominated in individual animals and at a population level. We corroborated sequencing results by qRT-PCR and virus isolation, and isolates replicated as ensembles in culture. Numerous instances of recombination and reassortment were detected, including recombinant segments with unusual organizations featuring 2 intergenic regions and superfluous content, which were capable of stable replication and transmission despite their atypical structures. Overall, this represents intrahost diversity of an extent and form that goes well beyond what has been observed for arenaviruses or for viruses in general. This diversity can be plausibly attributed to the captive intermingling of sub-clinically infected wild-caught snakes. Thus, beyond providing a unique opportunity to study arenavirus evolution and adaptation, these findings allow the investigation of unintended anthropogenic impacts on viral ecology, diversity, and disease potential.

SRP002437	infant time series	The colonization process of the infant gut microbiome has been called chaotic, but this view could reflect insufficient documentation of the factors affecting the microbiome. We performed a 2.5-year case study of the assembly of the human infant gut microbiome to relate life events to microbiome composition and function. Sixty fecal samples were collected from a healthy infant along with a diary of diet and health status. Analysis of >300,000 16S rRNA genes indicated that the phylogenetic diversity of the microbiome increased gradually over time and that changes in community composition conformed to a smooth temporal gradient. In contrast, major taxonomic groups showed abrupt shifts in abundance corresponding to changes in diet or health. Community assembly was nonrandom: we observed discrete steps of bacterial succession punctuated by life events. Furthermore, analysis of ~500,000 DNA metagenomic reads from 12 fecal samples revealed that the earliest microbiome was enriched in genes facilitating lactate utilization, and that functional genes involved in plant polysaccharide metabolism were present prior to the introduction of solid food, priming the infant gut for an adult diet. However, ingestion of table foods caused a sustained increase in the abundance of Bacteroidetes, elevated fecal short chain fatty acid levels, enrichment of genes associated with carbohydrate utilization, vitamin biosynthesis and xenobiotic degradation, and a more stable community composition, all of which are characteristic of the adult microbiome. This study revealed that seemingly chaotic shifts in the microbiome could be attributed to life events.	SRR068113,SRR068118,SRR068119,SRR068120,SRR068121,SRR069226

ERP010229	Gut microbial succession follows acute secretory diarrhea in humans	Disability after childhood diarrhea is an important burden on global productivity. Recent studies suggest that gut bacterial communities influence how humans recover from infectious diarrhea, but we still lack extensive data and mechanistic hypotheses for how these communities respond to diarrheal disease and its treatment. Here, we report that after V. cholerae infection, human gut microbiota undergo an orderly and reproducible succession featuring transient reversals in relative levels of enteric Bacteroides and Prevotella. Elements of this succession may be a common feature in microbiota recovery from acute secretory diarrhea, as we observed similar successional dynamics after enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli  (ETEC) infection. Our metagenomic analyses suggest multiple mechanisms driving microbial succession after cholera, including bacterial dispersal properties, changing enteric oxygen and carbohydrate levels, and phage dynamics. Thus, gut microbiota recovery after cholera may be predictable at the level of community structure, but driven by a complex set of temporally varying ecological processes. Our findings suggest opportunities for diagnostics and therapies targeting the gut microbiota in humans recovering from infectious diarrhea.

SRP004645	Nyegga Coldseep Sediment Metagenome	Anaerobic methanotrophic archaea (ANME) are major players in methane enriched marine sediments reducing the emission of this green-house gas to the Oceans, yet little is known about their in situ metabolisms and interspecies relations. A combined metagenomic and metaproteomic approach was applied to determine the metabolic pathways expressed in a naturally enriched ANME-1 community in cold-seep sediment at Nyegga. In total, 16.6 Mbp sequence information was assembled into contigs and taxonomic analysis revealed a dominance of Archaeal sequences comprising 74 % of the metagenome where ANME-1 constituted 66 % and ANME-2 0.01 %, respectively. Open reading frame translations were used as database for protein identifications and of the 356 proteins identified in the sediment sample, 245 were associated with ANME-1. All enzymes of the reverse methanogenesis pathway, except N5N10-Methylene-Tetrahydromethanopterin reductase (mer), were expressed in the sediments by ANME-1, hence validating on the protein level, anaerobic methane oxidation via this pathway in cold seep sediments. Any knowledge on bypassing-mechanisms of the mer-catalyzed reaction was neither retrieved from the metagenomic nor the metaproteomic data. However, although constituting, a minor fraction of the microbial community, an ANME-2c affiliated mer was expressed as well as the subunits of the key enzyme methyl-CoM reductase. The key enzymes, APS-reductase and sulfite reductase in the dissimilatory sulfate-reduction pathway were expressed in the sediments by at least two different members of Deltaproteobacteria. The approach is applicable to reveal dominating in situ metabolism on the protein level of ANME-dominated sedimentary ecosystems.	SRR074105,SRR074106

ERP014653	Hospital Metagenomics	The microorganisms that inhabit hospitals may significantly influence patient recovery rates and outcomes, though the complexity and diversity of these communities confound our ability to focus on potential pathogens in isolation. To develop a community level understating of how microorganisms colonize and move through the hospital environment, we mapped microbial dynamics between hospital surfaces, air and water to patients and staff over the course of one year as a new hospital became operational. Immediately following the introduction of staff and patients, the hospital microbiome became dominated by human skin-associated bacteria. Patient skin samples had the lowest microbial diversity, while the greatest diversity was found on surfaces interacting with outdoor environments. The microbiota of patient room surfaces, especially bedrails, consistently resembled the skin microbial community of the current patient within 24 hours of occupancy, with degree of similarity significantly correlated to higher humidity and lower temperatures. Microbial similarity between staff members showed a significant seasonal trend suggesting interpersonal microbial transmission in hospital environments is influenced by built environment parameters.

ERP003514	Cultured gut bacterial consortia from twins discordant for obesity modulate   adiposity in gnotobiotic mice	Efforts to characterize the human microbiome are producing large amounts of data about its organismal and gene content. A challenge is to complement these efforts with a preclinical research pipeline that directly tests the degree to which a person's physiologic or pathological phenotype relates to their microbiome. We illustrate such a pipeline by transplanting previously frozen, uncultured fecal microbiota samples from four sets of adult female mono- and dizygotic twins discordant for obesity into groups of adult germ-free mice fed a low-fat, plant polysaccharide-rich diet. Capture of a human donor's microbiota in recipient mice is highly reproducible. The increased adiposity phenotype of obese co-twins is transmissible not only with the uncultured fecal communities, but with bacterial culture collections generated from these fecal samples. Co-housing mice colonized with a culture collection produced from an obese co-twin's microbiota (Ob), with mice harboring the culturable component of the lean co-twin's microbiota (Ln) prevented development of an increased adiposity phenotype in Ob animals. These results correlate with invasion of specific members from the culturable component of the Ln co-twin's microbiota into the guts of Ob cagemates, and transformation of the Ob microbiota's metabolic profile to a lean-like state.

SRP093781	permafrost metagenome Raw sequence reads	Permafrost, perennially frozen earth material, is an environment where microbes must survive oligotrophic conditions, sub-zero temperatures, low water availability, and high salinity over millennia. Viable microbial life has been found in permafrost tens of thousands of years old. However, we know little about the metabolic and physiological strategies utilized by microbial communities in response to the challenges presented by life in frozen ground over geologic time. In this study we asked if age and the associated stressors have accumulating effects causing adaptive changes in community composition and function. We conducted deep metagenomic and 16S rRNA gene sequencing across a Pleistocene permafrost chronosequence ranging in age from 16,000 - 33,000 years before present (kyr). We found age-related differences in community composition and diversity that may reflect adaptation to life in permafrost over four millennia. Reconstruction of paleovegetation from metagenomic sequence suggests vegetation differences in the paleo record were not the cause for shifts in community composition and function. Rather, compositional and functional shifts were observed that were consistent with long-term survival strategies in extreme cryogenic environments. These include increased reliance on scavenging detrital biomass, horizontal gene transfer, chemotaxis, dormancy, environmental sensing, and stress response. Our results identify functional traits that may enable long-term survival in ancient cryoenvironments with no influx of energy or new materials. This has ramifications for the search for life on other planetsâ€”by understanding how microbial communities adapt to the stresses associated with frozen conditions over geologic time we may gain insight into survival strategies life (if it exists) might use on other cryogenic bodies.

ERP008851	Metagenomes and metatranscriptomes from the diffuse hydrothermal vents of Axial Seamount from 2013	This projects explores the functional diversity and activity of rocky subseafloor microbial communities in hydrothermal vent systems. Samples were collected in 2013 from a number of low temperature diffuse fluid vents at Axial seamount, located in the northeast Pacific Ocean. Shotgun metagenomics and metatranscriptomics were performed on four diffuse vent samples.  Previous work at this site determined the taxonomic structure and distribution of microbial communities in venting fluids, but the contribution and mechanisms of the different redox driven metabolisms and the impact these reactions have on vent chemical signatures have not been fully characterized. This study helps to determine the genetic potential and expression patterns of the largely uncharacterized subseafloor microbial community and shows how these patterns change across the complicated biogeochemical gradients of hydrothermal vent systems.

ERP000118	WEC diel study using 454 metagenonic and metatranscriptomic sequencing	Here we present a multi-omic study of the Bacterial and Archaeal diversity found at the L4 long-term marine observatory.  We have previously generated a six year time series from L4 that showed that the bacterial community shows strong seasonal structuring and diversity peaks every year on the winter solstice.  Here we further confirm this pattern by extending this study to include genes and transcripts generated for eight additional time points in 2008.  This data includes further 16S datasets as well as eight metagenomes (1.2 GB) and eight metatranscriptomes (157MB).  These time points cover three seasons (Jan, April and August) and include day and night (diel) samples.  In addition, the August samples (4) include 4 consecutive samplings within 24 hours at six hour intervals.  Using these data we test whether Archaea also show the same observed seasonal patterns and whether these patterns hold true at the gene (functional) level. Analysis of this combined data set allows five main conclusions to be drawn.  First, Archaea show evidence of following the same seasonal patterns as Bacteria, but have ~6% the richness.  Second, for both Bacteria and Archaea, we confirm that higher 16S diversity reflects higher diversity at the gene-level (including expressed genes) and this diversity also peaks at the winter solstice. Third, interestingly, detectable diversity appears to be higher at night, and this is of special potential relevance as there is more diversity in winter when nights are longer.  Fourth,  despite the diversity of these communities, night and day samples taken using Lagrangian (drift) sampling were successful in isolating the same community suggesting communities are more structured than is commonly believed. Finally, this data, as expected, contains a large proportion of orphan genes without known homologues.  When compared to the housekeeping genes identified through SEED subsystem classification, these unknown genes appear to be driving the differences between samples across seasons.  This underscores the importance of determining the functions of more of these sequences in the future. In summary, this study further confirms the strong seasonal patterns characterizing both the bacterial and archaeal communities at this important marine site.  The finding that, despite the huge diversity of these communities, there are evident signs of predictable patterns and detectable stability over time provides compelling evidence that renewed efforts should be focused on finding deterministic patterns in even the most complex microbial communities.

SRP090414	Freshwater chemosynthetic mat community metagenomic assembly	Little is known about large sulfur bacteria that inhabit sulfidic groundwater seeps in large lakes. To examine how geochemicallyrelevant microbial metabolisms are partitioned among community members, we conducted metagenomic analysis of a chemosynthetic microbial mat in the Isolated Sinkhole, which is in a deep, aphotic environment of Lake Huron. For comparison, we also analyzed a white mat in an artesian fountain that is fed by groundwater similar to Isolated Sinkhole, but that sits in shallow water and is exposed to sunlight. Our results show that groundwater-fed communities in an artesian fountain and in submerged sinkholes of Lake Huron are a rich source of novel large sulfur bacteria, associated heterotrophic and sulfate-reducing bacteria, and enigmatic archaea.

SRP045692	Metagenome of marine sediment near Loki''s castle	This study aims at examining the particular environment of Loki''s castle, to unveil novel archaeal lineages. In particular, members of the Deep Sea Archaeal Group were carefully examined, and a composite genome, extracted from metagenomes, was assembled and analyzed.  Two metagenomes were created from the same marine sediment sample. In the LokiAmp metagenome (SAMN03002195), DNA was amplified by MDA while in the Loki metagenome (SAMN03002196) it was not. Reads were corrected and assembled with SPAdes and then binned. One bin was selected for further analysis, since it was determined that contigs in that bin belonged to several, very similar (strain or species level) organisms. Contigs in this bin were filtered by coverage, to try to get as close to a single organism. Reads from Loki, corrected by SPAdes, were mapped to the whole Loki metagenome and reads mapping the selected contigs were extracted and reassembled. Contigs were then filtered again to form a composite genome (Lokiarchaeum), which is as close as possible to a single genome but is estimated to contain ~1.4 genomes. This composite genome (SAMN03002197) is a novel genus, and will probably be classified in a new phylum.	SRR1555743,SRR1555744,SRR1555748,SRR1555750

ERP005529	metagenomic study targeting N cycling processes	Sugarcane is a crop for bioenergy in Brazil and one of the main concerns in the production of this crop is the impact on the environment, in particular in greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions. Recent studies have shown that the N2O emissions related to sugarcane production are dependent on soil management practices (Carmo et al. 2013). The way to mitigate N2O emissions would be to understanding the conditions and the processes involved in the N2O production and consumption. However, no studies have linked the emissions of GHGs with soil-borne microbial communities, which are the main players in nutrient cycling.

ERP005594	Lime was injected to acid sulfate soils with aim to balance the acidity. The indigenous microbial communities before and after injection were investigated.	Due to very low inflows from the Murray-Darling Basin from 2007-2009, water levels in the Lower Murray River dropped to -1m AHD in April 2009. The low water levels and restricted water allocations during this hydrological drought period caused the acid sulfate soils subsequently acidified and salinized. Given the acidic drainage water presents a potential risk to the water quality and environmental values of the Lower River Murray, a subsoil neutralisation using a limestone slurry and a modified mole drain technique was applied. The aim of this trial is to examine whether the introduction of alkalinity (limestone) at depth in the oxidised and rewet acid sulfate soils, will sufficiently raise the pH to begin the process of sulfate reduction. It is hoped by promoting sulfate reduction, via sulfate reducing bacteria, the soils will begin to remediate, producing less acidic drainage to the salt drains in the irrigation areas.

SRP021021	Archaea and Fungi of the Human Gut Microbiome: Correlations with Diet and Bacterial Residents	Diet influences health by the delivery of nutrients and toxins to the human body, and by shaping the composition of resident microbial populations. Previous studies have begun to map out associations between diet and the bacteria and viruses of the human gut microbiome. Here we investigate associations of diet with fungal and archaeal populations, taking advantage of samples from 98 well-characterized individuals. Diet was quantified using inventories scoring both long-term and recent diet, and archaea and fungi were characterized by deep sequencing of marker genes in DNA purified from stool. For fungi, we found 66 genera, with generally mutually exclusive presence of either the phyla Ascomycota or Basiodiomycota. Methanobrevibacter was the most prevalent archaea, present in 30% of samples. Several other archaeal genera were detected in lower abundance and frequency. Myriad associations were detected for fungi and archaea with diet, with each other, and with bacterial lineages. Methanobrevibacter and Candida were positively associated with diets high in carbohydrates, but negatively with diets high in amino acids, protein, and fatty acids. A previous study emphasized that bacterial population structure was associated primarily with long-term diet, but high Candida abundance was most strongly associated with the recent consumption of carbohydrates. Methobrevibacter abundance was associated with both long term and recent consumption of carbohydrates. These results confirm earlier targeted studies and provide a host of new associations to consider in modeling the effects of diet on the gut microbiome and on human health.

We also collected a background seawater sample away from the volcano caldera, at 1500m depth as well as within a hydrothermal plume above Anemone vent. Shotgun metagenomics and metatranscriptomics were performed on the three diffuse vent samples as well as the background and plume sample. This study helps to determine the genetic potential and expression patterns of the largely uncharacterized subseafloor microbial community and shows how these patterns change across the complicated biogeochemical gradients of hydrothermal vent systems.

SRP064797	Marine microorganisms cultured in chemostats - Metagenomes	8 chemostat metagenomes are presented.  Description of the experiment:  The metagenomes were derived from prokaryotic communities grown in 4 chemostats. Samples for inoculation of the chemostats originated from the upper 2 cm sediment layer of the intertidal flat â€žJanssandâ€œ; Spiekeroog backbarrier area. Two cultures were incubated in 2011 (sampling on Janssand conducted in March 2011) at different temperatures: 10 vs. 25 Â°C. A replication of these incubations was conducted in 2012 (sampling on Janssand conducted in March 2012).  Aim of the investigation was to elucidate the influence of moderately low (10 Â°C) vs. moderately high (25 Â°C) temperatures on the sampled communities. The communities were grown under denitrifying conditions as most as possible similar to in situ conditions: anaerobic, dark, low nutrient concentrations (micromolar range), nitrite as electron acceptor, carbon mixture (mimicking the composition of decaying biomass) as electron donor. The cultures were maintained under constant conditions and dense observation with respect to substrate turnover (periodic determination of metabolic products). Metagenomes and â€“transcriptomes were aimed to deliver additional information on the metabolic capabilities of the enriched communities.  Description of the samples used for metagenomic sequencing:  Two chemostat cultures, grown under denitrifying conditions in 2011 at 10 and 25 Â°C, respectively, were each sampled once for sequencing. Samples were taken at t=97 days (25 Â°C culture), and t=101 days (10 Â°C culture) of culture lifetime. Two chemostat cultures, grown in 2012 under comparable conditions as in 2011, were each sampled three times for sequencing. Samples were taken at t=35, t=64, and t=86 days of culture lifetime for both cultures.  Metagenomic DNA was extracted from all samples and sequenced using the the 454 technology (2011 samples) or the ion torrent technology (2012 samples), and the reads were assembled into contigs.

SRP090800	Metagenomic reconstruction of bacterioplankton community metabolism in the northern Gulf of Mexico Dead Zone	Raw reads of bacterioplankton metagenomes and metatranscriptomes from the northern Gulf of Mexico dead zone.Marine regions that experience low dissolved oxygen (DO) from seasonal to long-term time scales, a.k.a. dead zones, are increasing in number and severity around the globe with deleterious effects on ecology and economics. One of the largest of these occurs on the continental shelf of the northern Gulf of Mexico (nGOM) as a result of eutrophication-enhanced bacterioplankton respiration and strong stratification. The effects of this perturbation on microbial assemblages, and therefore the underlying potential for biogeochemical cycling, have only begun to be explored. Here we present 77 high-quality genomes (33 of which are >70% complete) reconstructed from whole community metagenomic data spanning six sites of varying DO concentrations during the 2013 nGOM dead zone. All but two genomes could be classified into 17 named bacterial and archaeal phyla, and many represented the most abundant organisms observed previously in the dead zone (e.g., Thaumarchaeota, Marine group II Euryarchaeota, Synechococcus, Actinobacteria, SAR406). Surprisingly, we recovered near complete genomes from the Candidate Phyla Parcubacteria (OD1), Peregrinibacteria, Latescibacteria (WS3), and ACD39. Metabolic reconstruction predicted roles for many organisms in various phases of nitrogen, carbon, and sulfur cycling. Importantly, many of the most abundant and/or most active taxa were predicted aerobes, suggesting electron donor-based niche partitioning. This work provides an important biogeochemical map for multiple phyla, helping to resolve the impacts of hypoxia on nutrient flow in the dead zone.

ERP003267	Reconstructing genome evolution in historic samples of Phytophthora infestans	Responsible for the Irish potato famine of 1845-49, the oomycete pathogen Phytophthora infestans caused persistent, devastating outbreaks of potato late blight across Europe in the 19th century. Despite continued interest in the history and spread of the pathogen, the genome of the famine-era strain remains entirely unknown. To characterize temporal genomic changes in introduced P. infestans, we shotgun sequenced five 19th-century European strains from archival herbarium samplesâ€”including the oldest known European specimen, collected in 1845 from the first reported source of introduction. We then compared their genomes to those of extant isolates. We report multiple distinct genotypes in historical Europe and a suite of infection-related genes different from modern strains. At virulence-related loci, several now-ubiquitous genotypes were absent from the historical gene pool. At least one of these genotypes encodes a virulent phenotype in modern strains, which helps explain the 20th centuryâ€™s episodic replacements of European P. infestans lineages.

SRP092411	Whitebark pine transcriptome profiling for understanding genetic resistance to white pine blister rust	Whitebark pine (WBP, Pinus albicaulis Engelm.) is an endangered conifer species due to heavy mortality from white pine blister rust (WPBR, caused by Cronartium ribicola) and mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae). Information about genetic diversity and population structure is of fundamental importance for its conservation and restoration. However, current knowledge on the genetic constitution and genomic variation is still limited for WBP. In this study, an integrated genomics approach was applied to characterize seed collections from WBP breeding programs in western North America.	SRR4786283

SRP059760	Mus musculus Metagenome	Genetics provides a potentially powerful approach to dissect host-gut microbiota interactions. Toward this end, we profiled gut microbiota using 16S rRNA gene sequencing in a panel of 110 diverse inbred strains of mice. This panel has previously been studied for a wide range of metabolic traits and can be used for high-resolution association mapping. Using a SNP-based approach with a linear mixed model we estimated the heritability of microbiota composition. We conclude that in a controlled environment the genetic background accounts for a significant fraction of abundance of most common microbiota. The mice were previously studied for response to a high-fat/high-sucrose diet, and we hypothesized that the dietary response was determined in part by gut microbiota composition. We tested this using a cross-fostering strategy in which a strain showing a modest response, SWR/J, was seeded with microbiota from a strain showing a strong response, AXB19/TyJ. Consistent with a role of microbiota in dietary response, the cross-fostered SWR/J pups exhibited a significantly increased response in weight gain. To examine specific microbiota contributing to the response, we identified various genera whose abundance correlated with dietary response. Among these, we chose Akkermansia muciniphila, a common anaerobe previously associated with metabolic effects. When administered to strain AXB19/TyJ by gavage, the dietary response was significantly blunted for obesity, plasma lipids, and insulin resistance. In an effort to further understand host-microbiota interactions, we mapped loci controlling microbiota composition and prioritized candidate genes. Our publicly available data provide a resource for future studies.	SRR2074138,SRR2074139,SRR2074398

ERP010252	Controlling enteric pathogens of poultry	There is rich genetic diversity in Indiaâ€™s native poultry breeds, and the hybrid exotic lines often used in Indian commercial production are distinct from the majority of poultry reared in the UK. The prevalence and dynamics of gastrointestinal infection at farm-level has a direct bearing on economic risk to individual farmers and contributes to overall global concerns of food security and food safety.Changes to diet, use of vaccines or antimicrobials, and flock-level interventions such as â€˜thinningâ€™, can have profound effects on intestinal health and the evolution and spread of disease-causing microbes and may be amplified by genetic variation in host and microbe populations. Whilst major advances in genomics and genotyping of commercial poultry lines is facilitating the identification of loci linked to susceptibility or resistance, the impact of host and pathogen diversity on disease and production outcomes remains largely unexplored.

SRP075617	seawater metagenome Genome sequencing and assembly	In this study, we simulate the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in a laboratory system, with the indigenous seawater from the spill site and depth, Macondo oil, and dispersant (Corexit 9500) used during the spill. Successive samples were taken for chemical and metagenomic studies. From the assembled contigs, we isolated the dominant Oceanospirillaceae genome. This study showed that the succession of the microbial community coincide with the genomesâ€™ use of hydrocarbon substrates. In general, n-alkane users will rise first, succeeded by mono-ring aromotics, then by multi-ring aromatics. The succession pattern was probably controlled by nutrient availability and the metabolic rates that the group of substrates can sustain. Multiple genomes of Colwellia, Cycloclasticus, members of Gamma-Proteobacteria, flavor bacteria and Rhodobacteria were also resolved, providing insights on potential cooperation or competition in the environment among closely related bacteria.

ERP006376	Metagenomic sequencing of a Bison priscus bone sample from the Trois-Freres cave (Ariege, France)	The steppe bison (Bison priscus) is an extinct species that was widely distributed in Europe, Central Asia, Beringia and North America during the Pleistocene. It is known from abundant remains, including complete animals found in the permafrost, and from Palaeolithic rock-art pictures. However, the molecular information available for this species is limited to a fragment of the mitochondrial genome control region. In order to obtain a thorough genetic characterization of the steppe bison, we performed high-throughput shotgun sequencing of DNA extracted from a specimen of the Trois-Freres cave (Ariege, France). Analysis of several bone samples from the Salle du Grand Eboulis of this cave enabled identifying a rib from which bison DNA could be reproductively recovered and amplified by PCR. One DNA extract obtained from this rib was converted into an Illumina library, and about 1 billion DNA reads were analysed. Using these sequence data we reconstructed a complete mitochondrial genome of 16,318 bp with an average unique read depth of 10x	ERR566212,ERR566213,ERR566214,ERR566215,ERR566216,ERR566217,ERR566218

ERP009310	Bariatric surgery induces long-term changes on the gut metagenome contributing to fat mass regulation	Bariatric surgery is the most effective procedure for the treatment of obesity. Given the role of the gut microbiota in regulating host metabolism and adiposity, we investigated the long-term effects of bariatric surgery on the human gut metagenome in patients randomized to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and vertical banded gastroplasty. Genera of the Proteobacteria were specifically enriched after bypass, and the abundance of genes for fatty acid metabolism, nitrogen metabolism and two-component systems was increased after both procedures nine years after surgery. Through colonization of germ-free mice with stools from the patients we demonstrated that the altered gut microbiota promoted reduced fat deposition in recipient mice. Recipients of bypass microbiota also had a lower respiratory quotient, indicating decreased utilization of carbohydrates as fuel. Our results suggest that the gut microbiota may play a direct role in the reduction of adiposity observed after bariatric surgery.

SRP060520	Terrestrial subsurface C, N, S and H cycles cross-linked by metabolic handoffs	Subsurface processes impact the composition and functioning of the biosphere and atmosphere over both short and geological timescales. Below the soil zone, the microorganisms that mediate transformations of nutrients, trace gases and contaminants are particularly poorly understood. Here, we analyzed 2,542 high-quality draft and complete bacterial and archaeal genomes newly reconstructed from terabases of sequence data collected from sediment and groundwater. This unprecedented scale of genome sampling from a single site represents ~28% of the organisms detected. Analysis of the genome dataset revealed that multiple organisms, including some from ~34 newly detected phyla, are often required to complete redox pathways. Thus, we infer that a complex network of metabolic handoffs extensively cross-links subsurface biogeochemical cycles.

ERP013165	The Pigâ€™s other genome: a reference gene catalogue of the gut microbiome	Pig is a main species for livestock and biomedicine. The pig genome sequence was recently reported. To boost research, we established a catalogue of the genes of the gut microbiome based on faecal samples of 287 pigs from France, Denmark and China. More than 7.6 million non-redundant genes representing 719 metagenomic species were identified by deep metagenome sequencing, highlighting more similarities with the human than with the mouse catalogue. The pig and human catalogues share only 12.6 and 9.3 % of their genes, respectively, but 70 and 95% of their functional pathways. The pig gut microbiota is influenced by gender, age and breed. Analysis of the prevalence of antibiotics resistance genes (ARGs) reflected antibiotics supplementation in each farm system, and revealed that non-antibiotics-fed animals still harbour ARGs. The pig catalogue creates a resource for whole metagenomics-based studies, highly valuable for research in biomedicine and for sustainable knowledge-based pig farming.

SRP008669	Microbiomes of ant castes implicate new microbial roles in the fungus-growing ant Trachymyrmex septentrionalis	Fungus-growing ants employ several defenses against diseases, including disease-suppressing microbial biofilms on their integument and in fungal gardens.  Here, we compare the phenology of microbiomes in natural nests of the temperate fungus-growing ant Trachymyrmex septentrionalis, using culture-dependent isolations and culture-independent 16S-amplicon 454-sequencing.  454-sequencing revealed diverse actinobacteria associated with ants, including most prominently Solirubrobacter (12.2-30.9% relative abundance), Pseudonocardia (3.5-42.0%), and Microlunatus (0.4-10.8%).  Bacterial abundances remained relatively constant in monthly surveys throughout the annual active period (late winter to late summer), except Pseudonocardia abundance declined in females during the reproductive phase.  Pseudonocardia species that occur abundantly on ants are phylogenetically different from those in gardens and soil, indicating ecological separation of these Pseudonocardia types.  Because the pathogen Escovopsis is not known to infect gardens of T. septentrionalis, the ant-associated microbes do not seem to function in Escovopsis suppression, but could protect against other diseases, help in nest sanitation, or serve unknown functions.

ERP012972	Microbial metagenome sequencing from marine sponges (Spongia sp.), seawater and sediments	Marine sponges host abundant and diverse associated bacteria, some of which known to produce biologically active natural products. Although much research effort has been applied to cultivate sponge-associated microorganisms, we still lack the ability to capture the full phylogenetic breadth of this symbiotic consortium in the laboratory. This study uses a cultivation-independent, shotgun metagenomics approach to unveil the taxonomic and functional features of the model sponge host Spongia sp. and its environmental surroundings (seawater and sediments). Samples were taken off the coast of Algarve, South Portugal (North-east Atlantic), and subjected to Illumina sequencing after microbial metagenomic DNA extraction. Taxonomic and functional profiles were assessed using MG-RAST with the Genbank and COG databases, respectively. Most abundant phyla in the sponge microbiome were Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi, Cyanobacteria, Planctomycetes and Acidobacteria, in this order, altogether comprising 84.35% of all the classifiable sequence reads. In contrast, the dominant phyla in seawater were Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria (89.3% of all classifiable reads), whereas sediments were dominated by Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Planctomycetes, Actinobacteria and Firmicutes (85%). We found significantly higher frequencies of transcription and translation termination factors in sediments and seawater, respectively, than in marine sponge microbial metagenomes. Moreover, higher abundances of motility and chemotaxis gene reads were found in the former microhabitats in comparison with the marine sponge microbiome, where a conspicuously higher frequency of Clustered Regularly Interspaced Palindromic Repeats (CRISPRs), accompanied by much lower viral abundance, was otherwise observed. These results suggest a highly distinct microbiome inhabiting Spongia sp., both in terms of taxonomy and function, characterized by the prevalence of k-strategy prokaryotes which collectively possess a sophisticated, early-branched viral defence system.

SRP006081	Extensive personal human gut microbiota culture collections characterized and manipulated in gnotobiotic mice	The proportion of the human gut bacterial community that is recalcitrant to culture remains poorly defined. In this report, we combine high-throughput anaerobic culturing techniques with gnotobiotic animal husbandry and metagenomics to show that the human fecal microbiota consists largely of taxa and predicted functions that are represented in its readily cultured members. When transplanted into gnotobiotic mice, complete and cultured communities exhibit similar colonization dynamics, biogeographical distribution, and responses to dietary perturbations. Moreover, gnotobiotic mice can be used to shape these personalized culture collections to enrich for taxa suited to specific diets. We also demonstrate that thousands of isolates from a single donor can be clonally archived and taxonomically mapped in multi-well format to create personalized microbiota collections. Retrieving components of a microbiota that have co-existed in single donors who have physiologic or disease phenotypes of interest and reuniting them in various combinations in gnotobiotic mice should facilitate pre-clinical studies designed to determine the degree to which tractable bacterial taxa are able to transmit donor traits or influence host biology.

SRP065752	Human gut microbiome raw sequence reads	A mechanistic understanding of the purported health benefits conferred by consumption of probiotic bacteria has been limited by our knowledge of the resident gut microbiota and its interaction with the host. Here, we detail the impact of a single-organism probiotic, Lactobacillus casei Zhang (LcZ), on the structure and functional dynamics (gene expression) of the gut microbiota in a study of 6 healthy individuals, 20 to 30 years old. The analysis revealed that while the overall community composition was stable as assessed by metagenomics DNA profiling, the transcriptional response of the gut microbiota was modulated by probiotic treatment. Comparison of transcriptional profiles based on taxonomic composition yielded distinct transcriptome groups that displayed considerable differences in functional dynamics.

ERP017329	Membrane bioreactor-based wastewater treatment plant - Reduction of Viral Diversity, Load and Infectious Capacity	A membrane bioreactor (MBR)-based wastewater treatment plant was assessed for its efficacy to treat and remove viruses from untreated wastewater over a 9-month period. Viral diversity were detected by omics-based approaches. Adenoviruses (AdV) and enteroviruses (EV) were enumerated for their log reduction values (LRV) by digital PCR, and assessed for their infectious particles load using cell culture and immunofluorescence staining. The findings revealed that MBR treatment was successful in reducing the number of viral species throughout the treatment train. However, plant viruses like cucumber green mottle mosaic virus and melon necrotic spot virus remained abundant in the treated effluent. The presence of these plant viruses in treated effluent can undermine the use of such waters for agricultural irrigation. Human enteric viruses were present in comparatively lower abundance than the plant viruses, and were effectively removed by the MBR although at varying LRV for different enteric viruses. AdV copy numbers were reduced by 3.7-logs through the MBR. No infectious AdV particles were found in effluent. In contrast, EV were less effectively removed by the MBR process. The EV copy numbers reduced by 1.7-logs post MBR while infectious EV decreased by an average of 2.0-logs. However, infectious EV remained in the chlorinated effluent, and occasionally in concentrations that approximate to the infectious dose. Overall results showed that a MBR-based WWTP effectively reduced viral diversity, viral load and its infectious capacity. However, differences in the removal efficiencies between AdV and EV particles were observed. Coupled with the presence of infectious EV particles in the chlorinated effluent, the findings suggest a potential concern arising from EV during reuse events. In addition, assessment of treated water quality should take into consideration of both infectious viral concentrations and LRV-centric guidelines.

However, little is known about the functional potential of the microbial communities inhabiting this environment, which is of key importance to predict potential feedback effects, such as increased emissions of greenhouse gas. A metagenomic analysis was performed on soil profiles from two meadow sites on the Tibetan Plateau, either affected by permafrost (site Huashixia [HUA]) or seasonal freezing (Site Haibei Station [HAI]). The goal was to determine how respiratory and fermentative pathways varied with soil depth and across sites.	ERR458084

Genome sequencing	This research project considers the genetic mechanisms of vertebrate diversification from two perspectives. The first is that of population genetics. How many genes experience divergent selection during the evolution of new species? How are they distributed across the genome? The second perspective is that of the evolution of development. Which genes are modified to produce new phenotypes? The flock of some 800 closely related cichlids fishes in Lake Malawi are an ideal model system for this study. These species differ in the shape of their jaws and teeth, the color of their skin, and their mechanisms of sex determination.

SRP007685	New Dominant Microbial Groups Along A Salinity Gradient	We describe community structure of two hypersaline solar salterns, an intermediate salinity pond (19%) and the other a crystallizer pond (37%) using pyrosequencing.  The analyses of these large metagenomes (nearly 784 Mb), in combination with previously available datasets along the salinity gradient confirmed known trends e.g. the vast dominance of the square archaeon Haloquadratum walsbyi, but also revealed novel, dominant and previously unsuspected microbial groups. We describe for the first time, a low GC actinobacterial group abundant in low and intermediate salinity systems. The surprising diversity of the intermediate salinity habitat was also reflected in discovery of microbes that were not known to have halophilic tendencies e.g. Clavibacter, Gramella. Stringent metagenomic assembly revealed the a dominant  novel low-GC euryarchaeota and another as yet unidentified gammaproteobacteria. Single cell sequencing of an archaeal genome obtained using multiple displacement amplification yielded a draft genome which indicated a photoheterotrophic, and polysaccharide degrading lifestyle of an abundant low GC euryarchaote, related to Nanohaloarchaea, with the lowest GC content described so far for any euryarchaeote. The assembled metagenomic contigs of the high GC gammaproteobacterium indicated that it is most closely related to the halophilic genus Alkalilimnicola and the non-halophilic genus Nitrococcus and is likely a heterotroph. These unexpected discoveries reveal the utility of an unbiased metagenomic approach to understanding and describing even previously well described microbial community assemblages.

However, limit knowledge is known about the antibiotic concentrations in influents that exert selection for antibiotic resistance in biological wastewater treatment systems.Herein, this study investigated the long-term effects of different streptomycin concentrations on selection of antibiotic resistance in an aerobic biofilm reactor treating simulated antibiotic production wastewater(606 days)by using multiple culture-independent andculture-dependent methods. qPCR, high-throughput quantitative PCR and metagenomic sequencing were used to detected ARGs and MGEs.Although the efficient COD removal from 88.52% to 92.83%was observed across all six stages (streptomycin: 0, 0.1, 1, 5, 25, 50 mg/L), increasing streptomycin concentration caused proliferation of ARB, ARGs and MGEs.And the Minimum effectiveconcentration of streptomycin causing a significant increase of relative abundance of ARGs and MGEs was at the levels ranging from 1 to 5 mgâ€¢L-1. This work proposed an experimental significant effect concentration which can guide implementation of antibiotic emission limits into biological treatment systems.

ERP009422	Temporal and technical variability of human gut metagenomes	Background: Metagenomics has become a prominent approach for exploring the role of the gut microbiota in human health. However, the temporal variability of the healthy gut microbiome has not yet been studied in depth using metagenomics and little is known about the effects of different sampling and preservation approaches. We performed metagenomic analysis on fecal samples from seven subjects collected over a period of up to two years to investigate temporal variability and assess preservation-induced variation, specifically, fresh frozen compared to RNALater. We also monitored short-term disturbances caused by antibiotic treatment and bowel cleansing in one subject.  Results: We find that the human gut microbiome is temporally stable and highly personalized at both taxonomic and functional levels. Over multiple time-points, samples from the same subject clustered together, even in the context of a large dataset of 888 European and American fecal metagenomes. One exception was observed in an antibiotic intervention case where, more than one year after the treatment, samples did not resemble the pre-treatment state. Clustering was not affected by preservation method. No species differed significantly in abundance, and only 0.36% of gene families were differentially abundant between preservation methods.  Conclusions: Technical variability is small compared to the temporal variability of an unperturbed gut microbiome, which in turn is much smaller than the observed between-subject variability. Thus, short-term preservation of fecal samples in RNALater is an appropriate and cost-effective alternative to freezing of fecal samples for metagenomic studies.

SRP047512	Canadian High Artic Metagenomes	Microbial activity plays an important role in the fate of carbon compounds sequestered in permafrost ecosystems. Nonetheless, how the microorganisms influence carbon cycling is not clear due to the paucity of data on cellular activity of indigenous microbial communities in Arctic permafrost. The aim of this study was to monitor microbial community changes during a controlled slow thawing of the permafrost soils/cores.

ERP023388	A 30-fold coverage Vindija Neandertal genome from Croatia	We sequenced to 30-fold coverage the genome of a Neandertal individual from the Vindija 33.19 sample. Sequencing was carried out on the Illumina platform and all libraries were prepared with a single stranded library protocol. About 1/4 of the produced data was generated from a library treated with UDG which removes most of the ancient-DNA typical uracils created by deamination (library id=B8744). The rest of the data was not treated. Deposited sequences were adapter trimmed and mate-pairs were merged into a single sequence when ends showed high similarity. This release includes microbial contaminant sequences that did not map to the human reference genome.

The general objective of this project was to increase the knowledge of microevolutionary processes in soil fauna exposed to chronic pollution.More specifically, to advance in the knowledge of the genetic modifications and the gene expression strategies that allow slugs to cope against chronic polluted soils. The transcriptome of the terrestrial gastropod slug was de novo assembled and functionally annotated. Multiple tissues were pooled and used as sequencing template. As result, it has been partially covered the existing lack of gene sequence information about common slug. However, there is still no genomic information.	SRR3467022

ERP003955	Search Engine for Antimicrobial Resistance: a cloud compatible pipeline and web interface for rapidly detecting antimicrobial resistance genes directly from sequence data	Background Antimicrobial resistance remains a growing and significant concern in human and veterinary medicine. Current laboratory methods for the detection and surveillance of antimicrobial resistant bacteria are limited in their effectiveness and scope. With the rapidly developing field of whole genome sequencing beginning to be utilised in clinical practice, the ability to interrogate sequencing data quickly and easily for the presence of antimicrobial resistance genes will become increasingly important and useful for informing clinical decisions. Additionally, use of such tools will provide insight into the dynamics of antimicrobial resistance genes in metagenomic samples such as those used in environmental monitoring. Results Here we present the Search Engine for Antimicrobial Resistance (SEAR), a pipeline and web interface for detection of horizontally acquired antimicrobial resistance genes in raw sequencing data. The pipeline provides gene information, abundance estimation and the reconstructed sequence of antimicrobial resistance genes; it also provides web links to additional information on each gene. The pipeline utilises clustering and read mapping to annotate full-length genes relative to a user-defined database. It also uses local alignment of annotated genes to a range of online databases to provide additional information. We demonstrate SEARâ€™s application in the detection and abundance estimation of antimicrobial resistance genes in two novel environmental metagenomes, 32 human faecal microbiome datasets and 126 clinical isolates of Shigella sonnei.  Conclusions We have developed a pipeline that contributes to the improved capacity for antimicrobial resistance detection afforded by next generation sequencing technologies, allowing for rapid detection of antimicrobial resistance genes directly from sequencing data. SEAR uses raw sequencing data via an intuitive interface so can be run rapidly without requiring advanced bioinformatic skills or resources. Finally, we show that SEAR is effective in detecting antimicrobial resistance genes in metagenomic and isolate sequencing data from both environmental metagenomes and sequencing data from clinical isolates.

SRP046756	A Self-Inactivating Gamma-Retrovirus Vector for Severe Combined Immunodeficiency	Background        In previous clinical trials involving children with X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID-X1), a Moloney murine leukemia virus-based gamma-retrovirus vector expressing the interleukin-2 receptor gamma-chain complementary DNA successfully restored immunity in all patients but resulted in vector-induced leukemia through enhancer-mediated mutagenesis in 25% of patients. We assessed the efficacy and safety of a self-inactivating retrovirus for the treatment of SCID-X1.        Methods        We enrolled nine boys with SCID-X1 in parallel trials, in Europe and the United States, to evaluate treatment with a self-inactivating gamma-retrovirus (SIN-gamma-c) vector containing deletions in viral enhancer sequences.        Results        All patients received bone marrow-derived CD34+ cells transduced with the SIN-gamma-c vector, without preparative conditioning. After 12 to 38 months of follow-up, eight of the nine children were still alive. One patient died from an overwhelming adenoviral infection before reconstitution with genetically modified T cells. Of the remaining eight patients, seven had recovery of peripheral-blood T cells that were functional and led to resolution of infections. The patients remained healthy thereafter. The kinetics of CD3+ T-cell recovery was not significantly different from that observed in previous trials. Assessment of insertion sites in peripheral blood from patients in the current trial as compared with those in previous trials revealed significantly less clustering of insertion sites within LMO2, MECOM, and other lymphoid proto-oncogenes in our patients.        Conclusions        This modified gamma-retrovirus vector was found to retain efficacy in the treatment of SCID-X1. The long-term effect of this therapy on leukemogenesis remains unknown.

SRP061756	Environmental impact of synthetic and natural ?-triketone herbicides: detection, microbial adaptation, biodegradation and toxicity.	Conventional agricultural practices rely on uses of effective synthetic pesticides for managing weeds. Nowadays, there is more concern about the possibility of adverse effects of these substances on human health and ecosystems. Risk assessment and ecotoxicological monitoring of pesticides, including their main degradation products, are already required within the framework of European legislation. As a consequence, there is a need for a new generations of less environmentally dangerous molecules, such as lower impact pesticides, biopesticides and natural product-based pesticides. b-triketone natural herbicides, as many naturals products, are considered as biodegradable and less toxic than synthetic ones. However, studies on the fate and effects of natural products in the soil and water environment are practically non-existing. In this context, TRICETOX project aims to evaluate the possible risks and adverse effects of leptospermone, on microbial community applied at recommended field dose and ten times recommended field dose using a microcosm approach. In a first phase, dissipation kinetics of leptospermone was monitored in order to characterize the scenario of exposure of soil microorganisms. The impact of leptospermone on soil microbial community was investigated directly from DNA soil extracts using new molecular tools based on (i) qPCR targeting 16S rRNA gene sequences to estimate the abundances of total bacteria and phylum specific groups and (ii) pyrosequencing to get further insight in possible effect of leptospermone on genetic diversity of bacterial community.

ERP009131	The initial state of the human gut microbiome determines its reshaping by antibiotics	The human gut microbiota is affected by antibiotics, but the heterogeneous response between individuals remains unexplored. To specifically address this question and examine the effect of antibiotics on selection of resistance genes, we administered the second-generation cephalosporin cefprozil to healthy volunteers. Stool samples gathered before antibiotic exposure, at the end of the treatment and three months later were analyzed using shotgun metagenomic sequencing. We show that normal antibiotic treatment can alter the gut microbiome in a specific, reproducible and predictable fashion. Strikingly, we identified a subgroup of participants that were enriched in opportunistic pathogen Enterobacter cloacae after exposure to the antibiotic, an effect linked to lower initial microbiome diversity and to the Bacteroides enterotype.

ERP006091	Gut microbial metabolism shifts towards a more toxic profile with supplementary iron in a kinetic model of the human large intestine	Safety of oral iron administration in African children has been questioned as it is associated with an increased burden of infectious disease. However, it remains unclear to which extent oral iron administration affects the intestinal microbiome. Therefore, we here investigated the impact of multiple iron preparations and doses on the growth and metabolism of a human gut microbiota in a well-controlled in vitro model of the large intestine. Microbiome analysis showed clear iron-induced changes and prominent shifts included a decrease of Bifidobacteriaceae and Lactobacillaceae under iron-rich conditions, paralleled by an increase of  Roseburia and Prevotella. Metagenomic analyses showed a general enrichment of bacterial motility-chemotaxis systems under iron-rich conditions. Metabolome profiling showed that gut microbial activity markedly shifted from a saccharolytic to a proteolytic profile in response to iron. Levels of branched chain fatty acids and ammonia increased significantly, in particular under ferrous sulfate-rich conditions. Importantly, cell viability tests showed increased cytotoxicity of metabolite-containing effluent from iron-rich conditions. We also identified microbial metabolites with siderophoric activity that were specifically produced under low-iron conditions. Our data indicate that in the absence of host influences, iron induces a more hostile intestinal environment characterized by i) reduction of beneficial microbes and increase of certain bacterial species with pathogenic potential, ii) increased levels of bacterial metabolites that can impair the barrier function of the gut wall, and iii) increase of virulence-associated pathways of enteric pathogens. It can be envisaged that these in vitro phenomena also contribute to an increased risk for enteric infections in vivo.	ERR537005,ERR537006,ERR537007,ERR537008,ERR537009,ERR537010,ERR537011,ERR537012
SRP074853	Alterations in the oral microbiome associated with risk factors for oral cancer and their contributions to pathogenesis	Oral squamous cell carcinomas are a major cause of morbidity and mortality, and tobacco usage, alcohol consumption, and poor oral hygiene are established risk factors. To date, case-control studies have not considered the effects of these risk factors on the composition of the oral microbiome, nor microbial community associations with oral cancer. We compared the composition, diversity, and function of the oral microbiomes of 121 oral cancer patients to 242 age- and gender-matched controls using a novel metagenomic multivariate analysis pipeline. Significant shifts in composition and function of the oral microbiome were observed with poor oral hygiene (e.g. tooth loss, history of periodontitis), tobacco smoking, and oral cancer. Specifically, we observed dramatically altered community composition after tooth loss, with smaller alterations in current tobacco smokers, increased production of antioxidants in individuals with a history of periodontitis, and significantly decreased glutamate metabolism and polyamine synthesis in oral cancer patients. These alterations in the oral microbiome, in association with established risk factors for oral cancer, may contribute to its pathogenesis.

SRP009645	Termite Gut Metagenome	A long-standing mission for DOE is to replace fossil fuels with renewable sources of cleaner energy, such as hydrogen produced during plant biomass fermentations. Termites efficiently transform lignocellulose and humus into valuable sugars, fuels (hydrogen, methane), and other intermediates of interest for biotechnologists, by exploiting the metabolic capabilities of the diverse microbial symbionts inhabiting their hindguts. An understanding of the biochemical pathways used in the termite hindgut may therefore lead to more efficient strategies for converting biomass to fuels and other chemicals of interest. Similarly, an ability to harness the pathways directly involved in, or impacting upon, hydrogen production in the termite gut may one day make biological production of this alternative energy source from plant lignocellulose a viable option. This is a particularly attractive avenue to explore because the termite hindgut protozoa that host Endomicrobia appear to be hardwired to convert lignocellulose derived hexoses and pentoses into H2, resulting in nearly saturating H2 partial pressures within the gut.

SRP044185	Metal availability predicts community metallogenomes in marine oxygen minimum zones	Marine oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) are hotbeds of microbial diversity and biogeochemical cycling. The factors structuring OMZ microbial gene content and metabolic potential are complex and not well understood. This project sampled the major anoxic OMZ of the Eastern Tropical North Pacific to explore the hypothesis that trace metal availability shapes microbial gene content. Seawater for microbial metagenome was collected in June 2013 from multiple depths along the vertical OMZ redox gradient at two sites off Manzanillo, Mexico: Station 6 (nearshore; 18.9Â°N, 104.5Â°W; 30, 85, 100, 125, 300 m depths) and Station 10 (offshore; 18.8Â°N, 104.7Â°W; 30, 80, 125, 300 m depths). Community microbial DNA was extracted and shotgun sequenced using Illumina MiSeq technology (250X250 paired end) and analyzed relative to corresponding trace metal concentration measurements. De-multiplexed, un-merged sequence reads representing nine metagenomic datasets are deposited in the SRA in association with this accession number.

SRP014911	Hepatotropic viruses from human plasma using deep sequencing: a new generation diagnostic tool	Many viruses have been associated with liver diseases; however, their detection in patients suffering from hepatic disorders has been restricted to specific diagnostic tools such as PCR and serological assays. We conducted an unbiased metagenomics survey in plasma filtrates from patients affected by several hepatic disorders, including hepatitis B and C, autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Pooled plasma from four patients that tested negative for hepatotropic viruses was used as negative control. RNA and DNA libraries prepared from enriched viral particles were constructed and sequenced to catalog viruses present in plasma. Hepatitis viruses were readily detected at high coverage in three out of four samples with such diagnosis, while abundant GB virus C was found in the plasma derived from a patient initially diagnosed with hepatitis C. Torque teno virus sequences were found at high frequency in AIH and NASH samples, but were absent in hepatitis samples. After classification of sequences into human, endogenous retroviruses, bacteria, phage and virus taxa, a substantial fraction of reads in each library, ranging from 35% to 72%, remained unclassified. Unknown reads, altogether with virus, phage and endogenous retroviruses reads were assembled into scaffolds and then analyzed by BLASTx using the non-redundant protein databases. We assembled the full genome of a circovirus and extensive scaffolds that encoded proteins similar to those from mimiviruses, among others. We confirmed the presence of the circovirus and the known hepatitis viruses in our samples by PCR. Thus, we have established a reliable protocol for the identification of viruses in plasma that could also be adaptable to urine, bile, saliva and other body fluids.

ERP010092	Astonishing 35S rDNA diversity in the gymnosperm species Cycas revouta Thunb	In all eukaryotes, the highly repeated 35S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequences encoding 18S-5.8S-26S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) typically show high levels of intragenomic uniformity due to homogenisation processes, leading to concerted evolution of 35S rDNA repeats. Here, we compared 35S rDNA divergence in several seed plants using next generation sequencing and a range of molecular and cytogenetic approaches. Most species showed similar 35S rDNA homogeneity indicating concerted evolution. However, Cycas revolute exhibits an extraordinary diversity of rDNA repeats (nucleotide sequence divergence of different copies averaging 12 %), influencing both the coding and non-coding rDNA regions nearly equally. In contrast, its rRNA transcriptome was highly homogeneous suggesting that only a minority of genes (<20 %) encode functional rRNA. The most common SNPs were C- > T substitutions located in symmetrical CG and CHG contexts which were also highly methylated. Both functional genes and pseudogenes appear to cluster on chromosomes. The extraordinary high levels of 35S rDNA diversity in C. revoluta, and probably other species of cycads, indicate that the frequency of repeat homogenisation has been much lower in this lineage, compared with all other land plant lineages studied. This has led to the accumulation of methylation-driven mutations and pseudogenisation. Potentially, the reduced homology between paralogs prevented their elimination by homologous recombination, resulting in long-term retention of rDNA pseudogenes in the genome.

ERP009980	Metagenomic analyses of Rumen microbiomes reveals the functional isoforms driving microbial niche differentiation for nutrient acquisition and use	Metagenomics has provided insights into the species composition and function of microbial communities and revealed that many species even in highly competitive environments seem to share the same sets of genes for acquiring and utilising nutrients. This questions whether niche differentiation between microbes under competitive stress exists and if so, how it is maintained. Rumen microbes exist in a highly competitive, anaerobic environment, and compete for access to the limited nutrients available in the biomass consumed by the host. The rumen microbiome affects the efficiency and health of the host, and has been mined for novel enzymes and anti microbial peptides and is known as a potent contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. A better understanding of the structure and function of this community has large potential benefits. We generated separate metagenomic libraries from 14 Limousin cows. Following assembly, gene prediction and taxonomic assignment, SNPs were identified and functional isoform diversity (pN/pS) was calculated for each gene. The independent calculations from each sample were used to calculate confidence intervals for testing for diversity of function between microbes, a signature of niche differentiation. We identified significant differences in functional diversity between competing organisms in genes involved in carbon, amino-sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism, suggesting adaptation to utilizing different routes for nutrient acquisition in the rumen. This suggests that a greater understanding of the rumen microbiome and considering macro-ecological concepts, such as successional change and adaptation, are likely to improve strategies for increasing the efficiency and health of the host and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

ERP010530	Elixir marine metagenomics pilot - towards user centric service - Gut samples	Marine genomics and metagenomics (the study of genetic material recovered directly from marine environmental samples) are still in its infancy, but it is rapidly expanding. To prevent the large-scale implementation of such studies from being disruptive (where the data production is faster than the speed users are able to analyze and interpret it) there is an urgent need to establish dedicated data management e-infrastructure and bioinformatics pipelines specialized for marine research. The EBI metagenomics portal has for the last year analyzed 3 trillion nucleotides and an increase of 98% over the previous year. To address some of these challenges the Norwegian node suggests establishing a pilot towards marine metagenomics together with EBI and potentially other collaboration partners as a start for marine services. While EBI has developed the EBI-metagenomics portal, a generic pipeline, which aims to provide insights into the phylogenetic diversity as well as the functional and metabolic potential of the samples, the Norwegian node has developed Meta-pipe in the direction coupled with marine bioprospecting. Both approaches have their own strengths and weakness, and while there is some overlap in the respective approaches, it is clear that the optimal solution for the community would be harmonization and interoperability between the analysis platforms. The Norwegian node together with EBI and potentially other partners will harmonize existing pipelines and develop new or improve established components in the pipelines in order to establish long-term sustainable service platforms and not least to start building a "user community" for marine metagenomics analysis in ELIXIR	ERR695595,ERR895166

SRP115267	Development of Inflammatory Bowel Disease is Linked to a Longitudinal Restructuring of the Gut Metagenome in Mice	The gut microbiome is linked to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) severity and altered in late stage disease. However, it is unclear how gut microbial communities change over the course of IBD development, especially in regards to function. To investigate microbiome mediated disease mechanisms and discover early biomarkers of IBD, we conducted a longitudinal metagenomic investigation in a mouse model where dampened TGF-ÃŸ signaling in T cells leads to peripheral immune activation, weight loss, and severe colitis. IBD development is associated with abnormal gut microbiome temporal dynamics, including dampened acquisition of functional diversity and significant differences in abundance trajectories for KEGG modules such as glycosaminoglycan degradation, cellular chemotaxis, and type III and IV secretion systems. Most differences between sick and control mice emerge with disease symptoms. However, lipooligosaccharide transporter abundance diverges prior to immune activation, indicating that it could be a pre-disease indicator or microbiome-mediated disease mechanism. Taxonomic structure of the gut microbiome also significantly changes in association with IBD development, and the abundance of particular taxa, including several species of Bacteroides, correlate with immune activation. These discoveries were enabled by our use of generalized linear mixed effects models to test for differences in longitudinal profiles between healthy and diseased mice while accounting for the distributions of taxon and gene counts in metagenomic data. These findings demonstrate the utility of longitudinal metagenomics for the discovery of potential mechanisms through which the gut microbiome becomes altered in IBD.

SRP005617	Metatranscriptomic analysis of autonomously collected and preserved marine bacterioplankton	Community RNA sequencing, or metatranscriptomics, can be used to describe the relative abundances of transcribed genes, as well as the response of microbial populations to environmental stimuli in both observational and experimental settings.  Using the Environmental Sample Processor (ESP) platform, we developed and field-tested a protocol for automated collection and fixation of marine microbes that uses an RNALater treatment to preserve RNA in whole cells collected on filters.  Replicate microbial samples preserved using this protocol yielded discrete rRNA peaks and stable metatranscriptomic profiles over at least four weeks when stored at room temperature or onboard the ESP at in situ temperatures.  In a field test using the validated protocol, we used a morred ESP to remotely and automatically collect seawater samples from Monterey Bay for metatranscriptomic analysis.  cDNA libraries were synthesized and successfully sequenced using community RNA extracted from samples collected at four time points over the course of a single day. In all four samples, the oxygenic photoautotrophs were predominantly eukaryotic, while the bacterial community was dominated by proteorhodopsin-containing photoheterotrophs, with the most abundant groups being Polaribacter-like Flavobacteria and a Rhodobacterales bacterium sharing high similarity with Rhodobacterales sp. HTCC2255.  However, each time point was associated with distinct species abundance and expressed gene profiles.  These laboratory and field tests indicate that autonomous collection and preservation of bacterioplankton for transcriptional analysis is a promising approach for characterizing the expressed genes and environmental responses of marine microbial communities.

These soft corals are considered holobiont models but the diversity and functional aspects of its microbiota were not thoroughly assessed. In this work we focused on describing the microbiome associated with two species of zoanthids from Palythoa genus, P. caribaeorum and P. variabilis. To achieve that goal we performed Illumina shotgun sequencing of the metagenomic DNA from specimens collected in five locations along the Brazilian coast, considering two different spatial scales, from regional (tens of kilometers) to continental distances (thousands of kilometers).

SRP117271	Arbovirus minority variants required to traverse bottlenecks in the mosquito	Viral diversity is theorized to play a significant role during arbovirus infections, which must infect vertebrate and invertebrate hosts. To determine how viral diversity influences mosquito infection and dissemination Culex taeniopus mosquitoes were infected with Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus. Bodies, and legs and wings were collected and sequenced. Virus sequence diversity was calculated for each tissue. Differences were seen between mosquitoes with successful dissemination versus those with no dissemination. Diversity across time revealed that bottlenecks influence diversity following dissemination to the legs and wings, but levels of diversity are restored four days post-dissemination. Minority variants were identified in every tissue at every time point, suggesting that certain variants are important in mosquito infection and dissemination. This study demonstrates that the interaction between the mosquito and the virus results in changes in diversity and the mutational spectrum and may be essential for successful transition of the bottlenecks associated with arbovirus infection.

ERP003648	A gnotobiotic mouse model of phage-bacterial host dynamics in the human gut	The microbial diversity, interpersonal variation and dynamism of the human gut microbiota make the task of identifying the factors that define community configurations, both structural and functional, extremely challenging. Bacterial viruses (phage) are the most abundant biological group on Earth and are more genetically diverse than their bacterial prey/hosts. To characterize their role as agents shaping gut community structure, adult germ-free mice were colonized with a consortium of 15 sequenced human bacterial symbionts, 13 of which harbored one or more predicted prophage in their genomes. One member, Bacteroides cellulosilyticus WH2, was represented by a library of isogenic transposon mutants covering 90% of its genes. Once assembled, the community was subjected to a staged phage attack with a pool of live or heat-killed virus-like particles (VLPs) purified from the fecal microbiota of five healthy humans. Shotgun sequencing of DNA from the input pooled human VLP preparation plus shotgun sequencing of gut microbiota samples, and purified fecal VLPs, from the gnotobiotic mice revealed a reproducible non-simultaneous pattern of attack extending over a 25 day period and involving five phage, none described previously. This system allowed us to (i) correlate increases in abundances of specific phage present in the input VLP preparation with reductions in the representation of particular bacterial hosts, (ii) provide evidence that phage resistance occurred because of ecological or epigenetic factors, (ii) track the origin of each of the five phages among the five human donors plus the extent of their genome variation between and within recipient mice, and (iv) establish the dramatic in vivo fitness advantage that a locus within a B. cellulosilyticus prophage confers upon its host bacterium. Together, these results provide a defined community-wide view of phage-bacterial host dynamics in the gut ecosystem.

SRP000287	Direct metagenomic detection of viral pathogens in nasal and fecal specimens using an unbiased high-throughput sequencing approach	With the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic of 2003 and renewed attention on avian influenza viral pandemics, new surveillance systems are needed for the earlier detection of emerging infectious diseases. We applied a "next-generation" parallel sequencing platform for viral detection in nasopharyngeal and fecal samples collected during seasonal influenza virus (Flu) infections and norovirus outbreaks from 2005 to 2007 in Osaka, Japan. Random RT-PCR was performed to amplify RNA extracted from 0.1-0.25 ml of nasopharyngeal aspirates (N = 3) and fecal specimens (N = 5), and more than 10 microg of cDNA was synthesized. Unbiased high-throughput sequencing of these 8 samples yielded 15,298-32,335 (average 24,738) reads in a single 7.5 h run. In nasopharyngeal samples, although whole genome analysis was not available because the majority (>90%) of reads were host genome-derived, 20-460 Flu-reads were detected, which was sufficient for subtype identification. In fecal samples, bacteria and host cells were removed by centrifugation, resulting in gain of 484-15,260 reads of norovirus sequence (78-98% of the whole genome was covered), except for one specimen that was under-detectable by RT-PCR. These results suggest that our unbiased high-throughput sequencing approach is useful for directly detecting pathogenic viruses without advance genetic information. Although its cost and technological availability make it unlikely that this system will very soon be the diagnostic standard worldwide, this system could be useful for the earlier discovery of novel emerging viruses and bioterrorism, which are difficult to detect with conventional procedures.

Infections in the vessel wall might promote inflammatory responses and generation of a procoagulant and proatherogenic environment. A range of microbial agents have been reported to play a role in atherosclerosis. However, there is a lack of high resolution investigation of microbial infectious agents that may contribute to atherosclerosis. Recent progress in deep sequencing technology has provided a potential approach for high throughput and comparative analysis of microbial communities. This study employed deep sequencing and metagenomic analysis to provide a high resolution investigation of microbial species distributed in plaques obtained from atherosclerosis patients.

ERP010902	13C-cellulose stable isotope probing was applied to Californian forest soil from both organic and mineral soils. The data identifies cellulolytic taxa and impacts of three different timber harvesting strategies contrasted to unharvested pristine forest.	Soil management is vital for maintaining the productivity of commercial forests, yet the long-term impact of timber harvesting on soil microbial communities remains largely a matter of conjecture. Decomposition of plant biomass, comprised mainly of lignocellulose, has a broad impact on nutrient cycling, microbial activity and physicochemical characteristics of soil. Within the framework of the Long-term Soil Productivity Study, we tested whether timber harvesting, accompanied by varying degrees of organic matter (OM) retention, affected the activity and structure of the cellulose-degrading microbial populations sixteen years after harvesting. Using a variety of experimental approaches, including stable isotope probing with 13C-labelled cellulose in soil microcosms, we demonstrated that harvesting led to a decrease in net respiration and cellulolytic activity. The decrease in cellulolytic activity was associated with an increased relative abundance of thermophilic, cellulolytic fungi (Chaetomiaceae), coupled with a decreased relative abundance of cellulolytic bacteria in harvested plots, namely members of Opitutaceae, Caulobacter and Streptomycetaceae. In general, harvesting led to an increase of other stress-tolerant non-cellulolytic taxa. Stable-isotope probing improved shotgun metagenome assembly by 20-fold and enabled the recovery of ten metagenome-assembled genomes of cellulolytic bacteria and fungi. Our study demonstrates the putative cellulolytic activity of a number of uncultured taxa and highlights the mineral soil layer as a reservoir of uncharacterized diversity of cellulose-degraders. It also demonstrates the mitigating potential of OM retention, and contributes to a growing body of research showing persistent changes in microbial community structure in the decades following timber harvesting prior to canopy closure.

ERP001101	Virus_Discovery	Zoonoses caused by previously unknown aetiological agents represent a significant fraction of the global challenge posed by emerging infectious diseases (EIDs). Nearly 80% of zoonotic EIDs are estimated to originate from wildlife, and the overall contribution of wildlife pathogens to human EID events is increasing. For example, hantaviruses, henipaviruses, SARS-like coronaviruses and filoviruses are wildlife-origin zoonotic viruses discovered during the past 50 years. South and East Asia, Eastern Europe, Latin America and tropical Africa constitute areas of increased relative risk for zoonotic emergence from wildlife. Viral agents are estimated to account for 25 â€“ 44% of all EIDs and previous studies have shown them to be the class of pathogen most likely to emerge. Characterising the total viral populations (viromes) of candidate reservoir species in high-risk geographical areas is a logical initial step toward emergence prevention. Metagenomic methods enable such a comprehensive viral characterisation by sequencing nucleic acids directly from biological samples. Next generation sequencing technologies (NGS) produce vast amounts of data from small amounts of starting material at a relatively low cost, making these technologies a viable option for large-scale screening of metagenomic samples from wildlife reservoirs. Sequence information derived from these studies can then aid the selection of candidate pathogens for further empirical investigation of their zoonotic potential using more traditional virological and epidemiological methods.  Bats represent a natural choice for metaviromic investigations since they have been identified as the primary reservoirs for a series of recently-emerged zoonotic viruses which cause high case fatality rates, such as henipaviruses, filoviruses and some lyssaviruses. In this project we are applying a metagenomics approach based on NGS to characterise the virome of different bat populations.	ERR380872,ERR380876,ERR380877,ERR380880

ERP002231	Gene-targeted Metagenomic analysis of four NEON ecological sites in four different ecoclimatic zones using pyrosequencing targeting nitrogenase reductase (nifH) functional gene	Biological nitrogen fixation is an important driver of soil fertility and is carried out exclusively by nitrogen fixing Bacteria and Archaea. The nifH gene, coding for nitrogenase reductase, is commonly used as a marker for the nitrogen fixation pathway and is one of the best-studied ecofunctional genes. In this study, we applied nifH gene-targeted metagenomic analysis to examine the nitrogen-fixing microbial communities in 222 soil samples collected from four ecological sites in four different ecoclimatic zones. The taxonomic groups and ecological pattern were analyzed using RDP FrameBot, a frameshift-correction and nearest neighbor assignment tool. The nifH sequences related to the Proteobacteria phylum were the most abundant, followed by those for Cyanobacteria in the Alaska and Utah sites. Predominant genera with similar nifH sequences included Azospirillum, Bradyrhizobium and Rhizobium, the latter two without obvious plant hosts at the sites. The soil samples were grouped by site and correlated with soil environmental factors such as water content, organic matter, biomass, total carbon and nitrogen content. Indicator species were mostly Proteobacteria, but include diverse bacterial phyla and Archaea, most notably several Cyanobacterial indicators for the AK and UT sites.

SRP003580	Metagenomic analysis of marine microbes isolated during the Global Ocean Sampling Expedition	A broad objective of the Global Ocean Sampling (GOS) Expedition is to assess the genetic diversity in marine microbial communities and understand their role in fundamental processes in nature. Marine microbes influence the cycling of carbon (and other elements) in the world''s oceans, acting as a biological conduit that transports carbon dioxide from the surface to the deep oceanic realms. By sequestering carbon from the atmosphere, marine microorganisms (eukaryotes, prokaryotes and viruses) may significantly affect global climate. However, we know little about the physiological processes and complex interactions of communities that impact global carbon cycles and ocean productivity, and our attempts to study their activities are limited by our inability to culture the vast majority of them. These uncultured marine microorganisms are also a rich repository of novel genes and molecular structures that have potential in the development of biocatalysts for industrial and medical applications.  One avenue of exploration is to sequence the genomes of marine microbes using a metagenomics approach. In 2003, the J. Craig Venter Institute conducted a whole environment shotgun sequencing project to study marine microorganisms in the nutrient-poor Sargasso Sea near Bermuda. This study revealed a remarkable breadth and depth of microbial diversity - about 1,800 different prokaryotic species encoding over 1.2 million genes were discovered. Notably, this study expanded our knowledge of ocean photobiology, microbial diversity and evolution. Results from the pilot study were reported in Science in 2004.  This pilot study served as the springboard for launching a more comprehensive survey of the bacterial, archaeal and viral diversity of the world''s oceans. A global circumnavigation aboard the Sorcerer II sailing yacht began in August 2003, starting in Halifax, Canada and samples were collected at sites along the U.S. east coast, Gulf of Mexico, Galapagos Islands, central and south Pacific Oceans, Australia, Indian Ocean, South Africa, across the Atlantic back to the U.S., and was completed in January 2006. An initial analysis of the microbial sequence data from the first leg of the trip - Halifax to the Galapagos Islands was reported in a special issue of PLoS Biology on Ocean Meganomics in March 2007 (see <a href="http://collections.plos.org/plosbiology/gos-2007">http://collections.plos.org/plosbiology/gos-2007</a>). Additional data from the Indian Ocean was released in March 2008.  Shotgun sequencing and deep sequencing of 16S and 18S rRNA is currently underway on additional samples.  Collectively these studies have produced the largest catalogue of genes to date from thousands of new species, with no apparent slowing of the rate of discovery of novel gene families. These data have potentially far-reaching implications for biological energy production, bioremediation, and creating solutions for reduction/management of greenhouse gas levels in our biosphere.

SRP048760	Analysis of target DNA binding sites through NMR structural analysis of the MLV IN CTD and homology modeling of the CCD domains.	Target-site selection by retroviral integrase (IN) proteins has profound effects on viral pathogenesis. We describe the solution NMR structure of the Moloney murine leukemia virus IN (M-MLV) C-terminal domain (CTD) and a structural homology model of the catalytic core domain (CCD).  The MLV IN CTD adopts an SH3 domain fold followed by a long unstructured tail. We have obtained a concordant structural model of the MLV IN CCD using SWISS-MODEL, MMM-tree and I-TASSER servers. Using the PFV IN target capture complex X-ray structure and structure-based sequence alignment, residues within the CCD ?2 helical region and the CTD ?1-?2 loop predicted to bind target DNA in the context of the active MLV intasome were identified. The role of these residues in vivo was analyzed by point mutations and motif interchanges.  Chimeric viruses with substitutions at the CCD ?2 helical region and the CTD ?1-?2 loop result in viable virus and point mutants within those interchanges function similar to predicted PFV IN residue functions. Next-generation sequencing and analysis of local integration target sites indicate the CCD ?2 helical region, in particular P187, interacts with the sequence outside the target site duplication (TSD), whereas the CTD ?1-?2 loop bind to residues within TSD.

ERP002061	A method for identifying metagenomic species and variable genetic elements by exhaustive co-abundance binning	The microbial diversity of environments like the human gut extends far beyond what is covered by reference genomes. Here we present a method for exhaustive and unsupervised co-abundance gene binning across a series of highly complex metagenomic samples. As the method does not rely on previously sequenced reference genomes it allows for discovery of new species, viruses and clonal heterogeneity. We demonstrate the method on human gut microbiome data and identify 7,381 co-abundance gene groups (CAGs) ranging in size from 3 to 6,319 genes. The CAGs represent a wide variety of biological entities including microbial genomes, phages and clonal differences. We name the 741 largest of these metagenomic species (MGS), because they correspond to microbial species. In addition, we establish microbial host affiliations by dependency-associations for many small CAGs.

SRP007507	Exploring viral diversity in raw sewage	Currently virology is focused on the study of a relatively small number of viral species. Specific viruses are studied either because they are easily propagated in the laboratory or because they are associated with disease. The lack of knowledge of the size and characteristics of the viral universe and the diversity of viral genomes is a roadblock to understanding important issues such as the origin of emerging pathogens and the extent of gene exchange among viruses. Untreated wastewater is an ideal system for assessing viral diversity because virion populations from large numbers of individuals are deposited and because raw sewage itself provides a rich environment for the growth of diverse host species, and thus their viruses. These studies suggest that the viral universe is far more vast and diverse than previously suspected.   Raw sewage was collected and virus particles were purified by milk flocculation.

SRP052922	Exploring the bottom of the deep biosphere nearly 2.5 km below the seafloor	Extensive microbial populations inhabit deeply buried marine sediments along ocean margins, but the lower boundaries of this spacious ecosystem and the factors limiting its extent are poorly constrained. Here we provide evidence for the existence of microbial communities in sediment associated with lignite coalbeds buried nearly ~2.5 km below the seafloor off the Shimokita Peninsula, Japan, where ongoing microbial formation of methane is indicated by isotopic data of methane and carbon dioxide, methanogenic biomarkers, cultivation and gas composition results. Rigorous protocols aimed at minimizing and correcting for sample contamination resulted in concentration estimates as low as 1 cell cm 3 in numerous samples below 1.5 km subseafloor depth where temperatures range from ~40 to 60Â°C; only in coalbed-bearing sediments were cellular concentrations substantially elevated. The microbial ecosystem at this site appears situated close to the lower boundary of the subseafloor biosphere and is taxonomically distinct from shallower ecosystems at this location.	SRR1777635
SRP007749	Viral and Microbial Cystic Fibrosis Lung Metagenome	CF patients undergo recurrent pulmonary exacerbations. Prognosis and     treatment regimes are entirely based on clinical examinations and culture     results. Patients are typically treated with a common set of IV antibiotics     during pulmonary exacerbations. In addition to the improvement in lung     function, the eradication of 201C pathogenic 201D microbes based on microbe-targeted     assays serves as an indicator of recovery. However, there is often little     correlation between the beneficial outcome and the clearance of the     infection.

ERP023045	Whole shotgun metagenome sequencing of AD micro biome	The microbial community responsible for the biogas-producing anaerobic digestion (AD) process used to recover energy from waste is poorly characterised and likely contains many organisms not required for gas generation. Metagenomics approaches offer insights into AD communities that could potentially be exploited to improve the conversion of biomass to biogas, but distinguishing between the biological and technical variability of samples from different sources makes generalisation of results challenging. To determine how different DNA extraction methodologies and sequencing approaches influence the perceived microbiome, we analysed technical replicates of 16S rRNA amplicons and whole shotgun metagenomes from different AD systems. Here we show that diversity measurements of the microbiome in AD samples were strongly influenced by extraction regimes and analysis methodology. 16S rRNA amplification resulted in over- and under-estimation of several taxonomic phyla compared to a PCR-free metagenomics approach. Samples extracted using mechanical methods displayed significantly lower diversity and fewer observed phylotypes than samples extracted by chemical and thermal lysis, which produced higher molecular weight DNA and showed the greatest diversity in community profiles. Our results highlight that the most commonly used extraction and analysis protocols provide a skewed view of the diversity and species richness of the AD microbiome which is likely to extent to other samples. We suggest that methodological differences could be a significant source of variability among AD, and other, metagenomics studies.

SRP001731	Amino Acid Signatures of Salinity on an Environmental Scale with a Focus on the Dead Sea	The increase of the acidic nature of proteins as an adaptation to hypersalinity has been well documented within halophile isolates. Here we explore the effect of salinity on amino acid preference on an environmental scale. Via pyrosequencing, we have obtained two distinct metagenomic data sets from the Dead Sea, one from a 1992 archaeal bloom and one from the modern Dead Sea. Our data, along with metagenomes from environments representing a range of salinities, show a strong linear correlation (R2=0.97) between the salinity of an environment and the ratio of acidic to basic amino acids encoded by its inhabitants. Using the amino acid composition of putative protein-encoding reads and the results of 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, we differentiate recovered sequences representing microorganisms indigenous to the Dead Sea from lateral gene transfer events and foreign DNA. Our methods demonstrate lateral gene transfer events between a halophilic archaeon and relatives of the thermophilic bacterial genus Thermotoga and suggest the presence of indigenous Dead Sea representatives from 10 traditionally non-hyperhalophilic bacterial lineages. The work suggests the possibility that amino acid bias of hypersaline environments might be preservable in fossil DNA or fossil amino acids, serving as a proxy for the salinity of an ancient environment. Finally, both the amino acid profile of the 2007 Dead Sea metagenome and the V9 amplicon library support the conclusion that the dominant microorganism inhabiting the Dead Sea is most closely related to a thus far uncultured relative of an alkaliphilic haloarchaeon.

ERP022760	Vitamin and amino acid auxotrophy in anaerobic consortia operating under methanogenic condition	Synthrophy among Archaea and Bacteria facilitates the anaerobic degradation of organic compounds to CH4 and CO2. Particularly during aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon mineralization, as in crude oil reservoirs and petroleum-contaminated sediments, metabolic interactions between obligate mutualistic microbial partners are of central importance??1??. Using micro-manipulation combined with shotgun metagenomic approaches, we disentangled the genomes of complex consortia inside a short chain alkane-degrading reactor operating under methanogenic conditions. Metabolic reconstruction revealed that only a small fraction of genes in the metagenome-assembled genomes of this study, feature the capacity for fermentation of alkanes facilitated by energy conservation linked to H2 metabolism. Instead, inferred lifestyles based on scavenging anabolic products and intermediate fermentation products derived from detrital biomass was a common feature in the consortia. Additionally, inferred auxotrophy for vitamins and amino acids suggests that the hydrocarbon-degrading microbial assemblages are structured and maintained by multiple interactions beyond the canonical H2-producing and syntrophic alkane degraderâ€“methanogen partnersh?ip??2?. Our study uncovers the complexity of â€˜interactomesâ€™ within microbial consortia mediating hydrocarbon transformation under anaerobic conditions.

Microbial community DNA and RNA samples were collected from the ETSP OMZ as part of the Microbial Oceanography of Oxygen Minimum Zones (MOOMZ-1) cruise aboard the R/V Vidal Gormaz (June 12-23, 2008; late austral autumn). Seawater was sampled (via rosette) from four depths (50, 85, 110, 200 m) extending across the oxycline and into the upper OMZ at Station #3 (20* 07''S, 70* 23''W; ~1050 m water depth) off the coast of Iquique, Chile on June 16-17. Following a pre-filtration step (1.6 um filter), samples for RNA and DNA extraction were collected (onto separate 0.2 um filters) from the same water sample. Following extraction and a subtractive hybridization procedure to reduce levels of rRNA transcripts, total RNA was converted to cDNA and pyrosequenced along with the corresponding DNA sample for each depth.

SRP007098	Communities of deep marine water masses	The evolution of marine microbes over billions of years predicts that the composition of microbial communities should be much greater than the published estimates of a few thousand distinct kinds of microbes per liter of seawater. By adopting a massively parallel tag sequencing strategy, we show that bacterial communities of deep water masses of the North Atlantic and diffuse flow hydrothermal vents are one to two orders of magnitude more complex than previously reported for any microbial environment. A relatively small number of different populations dominate all samples, but thousands of low-abundance populations account for most of the observed phylogenetic diversity. This "rare biosphere" is very ancient and may represent a nearly inexhaustible source of genomic innovation.

ERP011260	Variation in the Microbiota of Ixodes ticks with geography, species and sex illumina	Ixodes scapularis is the principle vector of Lyme disease in the East coast and upper Midwest regions of the United States, yet the tick is also present in the Southeast, where Lyme disease is absent or rare. A closely related species, I. affinis also carries the pathogen in the South but does not seem to transmit to humans. In order to better understand the geographic diversity of the tick, we analyzed the microbiota of 104 adult I. scapularis and 13 adult I. affinis ticks captured in 19 locations in South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, Connecticut and New York. Initially ticks from 4 sites were analyzed by 454-pyrosequencing. Subsequently, ticks from these sites plus 15 others were analyzed by Illumina MiSeq. By both analyses female tick microbiomes were significantly less diverse than those of male ticks. The dissimilarity between tick microbiomes increased with distance between sites and the state in which a tick was collected could be inferred from its microbiota. The genus Rickettsia was prominent in all locations. Borrelia was also present in most locations, and was especially high in one site in Western Virginia. In contrast, Enterobacteriaceae was very common in North Carolina I. scapularis but uncommon in I. scapularis from other sites or in North Carolina I. affinis. These data suggest substantial variations in the Ixodes microbiota associated with geography, species, and sex.	ERR974315,ERR974316,ERR974327,ERR974385,ERR974398,ERR974399

In 1838, the crypt was sealed and forgotten until it was re-discovered in 1994, when it was found to contain the remains of over 200 individuals, most of whom had undergone natural mummification.  Previous pathological and molecular investigations have shown that around half of those sampled were infected with TB. Various tissues from these Mummies were sampled and underwent shotgun sequencing in order to characterize any TB present.

We collected a broad collection of bacteria isolated from mice covering the whole taxonomic range of common gut bacteria. Based on the high functional coverage by this collection of metagenomic gut samples obtained from mice we can use it to simulate several microbial profiles using minimal consortia of bacteria, facilitating the better understanding of the systems.

SRP006229	Gut microbiota and host intestinal transcriptome are significantly altered by formula feeding.	Formula fed infants are at increased risk for bacterial mediated diseases such as necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). However, the impact of diet on infant gut bacterial colonization and host gene expression remains relatively unexplored. Here, we quantitatively compare the colonic microbiota and transcriptional profiles of formula fed mice (FF) and maternal fed mice (MF) to test the hypothesis that diet impacts gut colonization and host gene expression.  7 day old C3HeB/FeJ pups were randomly assigned to FF or MF. After 72h of differential feeding, colonic tissue was collected for nucleic acid extraction. To evaluate the gut microbiota, 16S rRNA was amplified and sequenced on the Roche GS-FLX pyrosequencing platform.  Mothur software was utilized to perform operational taxonomical unit (OTU) clustering, Simpson diversity analysis, and principal coordinate analysis (PCA). To evaluate the host transcriptome, cDNA libraries were constructed and sequenced using the Solexa sequencing platform.  Reads were annotated by BLAST search against the mouse RNA database (NCBI build 37) and functionally classified using the KOG database (NCBI). The differentially abundant features were identified via Metastats.  After only 72h of differential feeding, 16S rRNA pyrosequencing demonstrated that Firmicutes (p<0.001) was the dominant phylum in the MF pups while Proteobacteria (p<0.001) and Bacteroidetes (p<0.001) were dominant in FF mice.  At the genus level, the colonic microbiota of FF mice had an increased relative abundance of Serratia (p<0.001) and Lactococcus (p<0.05) while that of MF mice had an increased relative abundance of Lactobacillus (p<0.001).  PCA demonstrated distinct clustering by diet.  After quality filtering, Solexa sequencing of 8 cDNA libraries resulted in 29,315,823 reads with average read length of 100bp. Blast search against the mouse RNA database yielded 18,014,657 hits to 19,703 mouse mRNAs. Overall, transcriptional patterns between MF and FF mice were relatively similar. However, a statistically significant (p<0.05) difference in mRNA transcript level was detected for 148 genes. Most notable was a 25 fold increase in heme oxygenase 1 (Hmox1), a marker of oxidative stress, in FF mice suggesting that formula feeding alone may induce oxidative stress in the developing gut.  Additionally, a decrease in Vinculin (Vcl) (p<0.05), a cytoskeletal protein associated with adherens junctions, and serine peptidase inhibitor, clade H, member 1 (Serpinh1) (p<0.05), a protein that stabilizes collagen cross-linkages, in FF pups suggests that gut structural integrity may be impaired with formula feeding.  Proteins involved with immune regulation, cell cycle control/gene expression, cell motility, and vascular function were also impacted by diet.    Formula feeding shifted the intestinal microbiota and host genes involved in structural integrity, the oxidative stress response, and immune function presumably making FF mice more vulnerable to disease development.  Further in-depth interrogation of microbial and host gene expression patterns in formula fed infants has the potential to shed new light on the pathogenesis of diseases such as NEC and improve current feeding formulations.

ERP005836	Combined meta-omics and physiological analyses of a cheese throughout a ripening cycle: towards an in-depth view of this food microbial community functioning	In our study, we explored the feasibility of using HTS to perform metatranscriptomics and metagenomics on an experimental cheese microbial community throughout ripening. Our methodological strategy is based on the establishment of a reference database of all the genomes of the community, onto which RNAseq data can be mapped. The choice of the cheese community is guided by a low level of microbial complexity (Ëœ10 species) which is sufficient to reproduce the complex metabolic pattern of cheese maturation (BonaÃ¯ti et al., 2005; Mounier et al., 2008). Furthermore, features (eg: aroma production, color, microbial growth, substrates uptake) generated by this microbial community are measurable in a reduced time scale (3 - 10 weeks). Finally, most of these microorganisms are cultivable with sequenced genomes available.  A first objective of our investigation centers on developing and optimizing experimental, analytical and statistical pipelines designed for meta-transcriptomics, genomics and physiological data analyses. By applying a joint metagenomic, metatranscriptomic and physiological approach, a second objective aimed to give a global view of this very peculiar microbial community being firstly regarded as a whole (= meta-organism) and, secondly, down to the species and the gene level.  To address these aims, we also considered the cheese microbial community in a dynamic manner, samplings being made at different times of the ripening process. Our data show that DNA datasets did not parallel RNA datasets. Furthermore, although transcriptional activity was essentially brought by yeasts â€“ and overrepresented by Geotrichum candidum, the relative importance of surface-ripening bacteria - in terms of DNA, RNA and cells counts - tends to increase with time.

SRP045113	Serratia marcescens strain:MCB Genome sequencing and assembly	Serratia is a genus of bacteria that is Gram-negative, motile, rod-shaped and belongs to the Enterobacteriacea family. Serratia species have been discovered from plants, vertebrates and invertebrates with over 70 species discovered in insects (Grimont et al., 1979; Chung et al., 2013). Recently Serratia nematodiphila was found to be mutually associated with a newly discovered entomopathogenic nematode (EPN) Heterorhabditidoides\Oscheius chongmingensis and Heterorhabditidoides\Oscheius rugaoensis (Zhang et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2012). The mutual relationship with EPNs results in Serratia species secreting various metabolites some of which have the ability to kill insect hosts and inhibit growth of competing bacterial and fungal species, and this has been seen in other bacteria such as Xenorhabdus and Photorhabdus (Wang et al., 2011). One metabolite with antibiotic activity secreted by Serratia marcescens is prodigiosin (Grimont and Grimont, 1978). Here we present the description of a complete genome and the annotation of Serratia marcescens strain MCB which was isolated from Oscheius sp. MCB discovered from South African soil.	SRR1534209

ERP001068	Functional diversity of soil microbes across environmental gradients	Numerous globally distributed 16S rRNA surveys of soil bacterial communities are     now revealing consistent trends in the main environmental drivers of     biodiversity. Soil pH is consistently revealed as the predominant correlate of     taxonomic diversity, with low pH soils comprising less diversity and being     dominated by a few broad taxonomic groups such as the oligotrophic acidobacteria     phylum. What is less clear is what these broad differences in patterns of     taxonomic diversity mean for the functional genetic potential of soils. The low     culturability of many taxa from low pH soils means that they are significantly     underrepresented in genome sequence databases. Therefore, this study aims to     provide a metagenomic comparison of geographically isolated soils of low pH with     neutral pH soils to identify any broad functional differences between soils of     similar taxonomic composition.

SRP018821	Asian longhorned beetle gut microbiome	The Asian longhorned beetle (Anoplophora glabripennis) is an invasive, wood-feeding pest that thrives in the heartwood a broad range of over 25 healthy deciduous host trees. Here, the insect faces a number of nutritional challenges, including limited access to nitrogen, vitamins, amino acids, and sterols. Most notably, the biggest challenge faced by this insect as it feeds in the heartwood is the lignin biopolymer, which surrounds and encases trace nutrients and structural carbohydrates that could be assimilated and utilized by the beetle. Despite this, we have conclusively demonstrated that the lignin biopolymer is actively degraded in the gut. We hypothesize that microbes housed in the gut harbor lignin degrading genes.  Fourth instar larvae actively feeding in the heartwood were collected from infested silver maple trees in Worcester, MA. Insects were dissected under sterile conditions and the insect-derived peritrophic matrix was removed to deplete the sample of insect-derived cells. DNA was extracted from the microbes associated with the food bolus.	SRR767751

ERP011577	The rumen microbial metagenome associated with high methane production in cattle	Background: Methane represents 16% of total anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions.  It has been estimated that ruminant livestock produce ca. 29% of this methane.  As individual animals produce consistently different quantities of methane, understanding the basis for these differences may lead to new opportunities for mitigating ruminal methane emissions.  Metagenomics is a powerful new tool for understanding the composition and function of complex microbial communities.  Here we have applied metagenomics to the rumen microbial community to identify differences in the microbiota and metagenome that lead to high- and low-methane-emitting cattle phenotypes.  Results: Four pairs of beef cattle were selected for extreme high and low methane emissions from 72 animals, matched for breed (Aberdeen-Angus or Limousin cross) and diet (high or medium concentrate).  High emitters produced 1.88Ã— more methane per kg DM intake than low emitters.  Deep sequencing produced on average 11.3 Gb per sample. 16S rRNA gene abundances indicated that archaea, predominantly Methanobrevibacter, were 2.5Ã— more numerous (P = 0.026) in high emitters, whereas among bacteria Proteobacteria, predominantly Succinivibrionaceae, were 4-fold less abundant (2.7 vs. 11.2%; P = 0.002). KEGG analysis revealed that archaeal genes leading directly or indirectly to methane production were 2.7-fold more abundant in high emitters.  Genes less abundant in high emitters included acetate kinase, electron transport complex proteins RnfC and RnfD and glucose-6-phosphate isomerase.  Sequence data were assembled de novo and over 1.5 million proteins were annotated on the subsequent metagenome scaffolds.  Less than half of the predicted genes matched matched a domain within Pfam.  Amongst 2774 identified proteins of the 20 KEGG orthologues that correlated with methane emissions, only 16 showed 100% identity with a publicly available protein sequence.  Conclusions: The abundance of archaeal genes in ruminal digesta correlated strongly with differing methane emissions from individual animals, a finding useful for genetic screening purposes.  Lower emissions were accompanied by higher Succinovibrionaceae abundance and changes in acetate and hydrogen production leading to less methanogenesis, as similarly postulated for Australian macropods.  Large numbers of predicted protein sequences differed between high- and low-methane-emitting cattle. Ninety-nine % were unknown, indicating a fertile area for future exploitation.

SRP040956	Choice of method for purification of bacterial DNA from faecal material influences community structure as detected by next generation sequencing	In this study we conducted a systematic comparison of the DNA extraction methods on feacal samples used by the two major collaborative efforts: The European MetaHIT and the American Human Microbiome Project. Additionally, effects of homogenizing the samples before extraction were addressed. We observed significant differences in distribution of bacterial taxa depending on the method. While eukaryotic DNA was most efficiently extracted by the MetaHIT protocol, DNA from bacteria within the Bacteroidetes phylum was most efficiently extracted by the HMP protocol. Whereas it is comforting that the inter-individual variation clearly exceeded the variation resulting from choice of extraction method, our data highlights the challenge of comparing data across studies applying different methodologies.

Samples were collected in 2011 and 2012 from a number of low temperature diffuse fluid vents at Axial seamount, located in the northeast Pacific Ocean. Shotgun metagenomics and metatranscriptomics were performed on four diffuse vent samples.  Previous work at this site determined the taxonomic structure and distribution of microbial communities in venting fluids, but the contribution and mechanisms of the different redox driven metabolisms and the impact these reactions have on vent chemical signatures have not been fully characterized. This study helps to determine the genetic potential and expression patterns of the largely uncharacterized subseafloor microbial community and shows how these patterns change across the complicated biogeochemical gradients of hydrothermal vent systems.

SRP056247	Deep subsurface microbial communities from Mt. Terri, Switzerland - Autotrophic microbial communities BRH/9 Metagenome	The subsurface biosphere is often cited to harbor vast microbial diversity and to represent a significant contribution to the planetâ€™s biomass. There is little understanding of the metabolic processes fueling these communities and the role of lithoautotrophic growth in nutrient cycling in the subsurface. H2 from geogenic sources such as serpentinization, radiolysis of water or hydrothermal fluid circulation is proposed as a fuel for microbial metabolism in deep subsurface environments where light dependent processes are limited to residual sedimentary carbon. The aim of this project is to identify the metabolic processes supported by H2 and characterize the lithoautotrophic microorganisms in the associated microbial community and to characterize the rate of consumption of H2 in these environments to account for microbial H2 consumption in their repository safety assessment models. To pursue these aims, we have built an underground in situ reactor that is delivering H2 to a borehole in the rock located at the Mt. Terri Underground Rock Laboratory in Switzerland that is instrumented to collect information continuously.We have been monitoring sulfate, sulfide, Fe(II), H2, CH4, organic acids, major cations and anions, alkalinity, borehole pressure as well as collecting samples for metagenomic analysis and for isotopic characterization (S, H and C).

SRP076728	Surveillance and diagnosis of viruses and viroids in quarantine plant samples	Plant biosecurity surveillance and diagnostics of viral pathogens is hampered by the fact that current available molecular assays are laborious, time consuming, expensive and only able to detect a subset of known plant viruses/viroids. Imported plants into Australia spend up to two years in quarantine resulting in a drastic impact on Australian trade both economically and socially. Recent studies demonstrated the detection of viral pathogens in the small RNA fraction of plant species. This offers an unprecedented paradigm shift to detect all known and novel viruses/viroids in a single small RNA next generation sequencing experiment that is also more cost-effective than current indexed PCR assays.

Viruses that are widespread in Europe and North America have previously been detected in African countries, however their prevalence in wild, unmanaged populations remains unclear. Here, we applied an unbiased high-throughput sequencing approach to test for the presence of known viruses in wild A. mellifera populations across Kenya and report the first identification of Israeli acute paralysis virus (IAPV). Comparison to North American populations revealed IAPV was less abundant in samples collected from Kenya, and phylogenetic analysis did not suggest evidence for multiple origins of the virus in sampled populations.

ERP006952	Metagenomics of TB-associated sputum	Tuberculosis remains a major global health problem. Laboratory diagnostic methods that allow effective, early detection of cases are central to management of tuberculosis in the individual patient and in the community. Since the 1880s, laboratory diagnosis of tuberculosis has relied primarily on microscopy and culture. However, microscopy fails to provide species- or lineage-level identification and culture-based workflows for diagnosis of tuberculosis remain complex, expensive, slow, technically demanding and poorly able to handle mixed infections. We therefore explored the potential of shotgun metagenomics, sequencing of DNA from samples without culture or target-specific amplification or capture, to detect and characterise strains from the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex in smear-positive sputum samples obtained from The Gambia in West Africa. Eight smear- and culture-positive sputum samples were investigated using a differential-lysis protocol followed by a kit-based DNA extraction method, with sequencing performed on a benchtop sequencing instru- ment, the Illumina MiSeq. The number of sequence reads in each sputum-derived metagenome ranged from 989,442 to 2,818,238. The proportion of reads in each metagenome mapping against the human genome ranged from 20% to 99%. We were able to detect sequences from the M. tuberculosis complex in all eight samples, with coverage of the H37Rv reference genome ranging from 0.002X to 0.7X. By analysing the distribution of large sequence polymorphisms (deletions and the locations of the insertion element IS6110) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), we were able to assign seven of eight metagenome-derived genomes to a species and lineage within the M. tuberculosis complex. Two metagenome-derived mycobacterial genomes were assigned to M. africanum, a species largely confined to West Africa; the others that could be assigned belonged to lineages T, H or LAM within the clade of â€œmodernâ€ M. tuberculosis strains. We have provided proof of principle that shotgun metagenomics can be used to detect and characterise M. tuberculosis sequences from sputum samples without culture or target-specific amplification or capture, using an accessible benchtop-sequencing platform, the Illumina MiSeq, and relatively simple DNA extraction, sequencing and bioinformatics protocols. In our hands, sputum metagenomics does not yet deliver sufficient depth of coverage to allow sequence- based sensitivity testing; it remains to be determined whether improvements in DNA extraction protocols alone can deliver this or whether culture, capture or amplifica- tion steps will be required. Nonetheless, we can foresee a tipping point when a unified automated metagenomics-based workflow might start to compete with the plethora of methods currently in use in the diagnostic microbiology laboratory.

ERP021566	Is there foul play in the leaf pocket? The metagenome of floating fern Azolla reveals endophytes that do not fix N 2 but may denitrify.	Dinitrogen fixation by Nostoc azollae residing in specialized leaf pockets supports prolific growth of the floating fern Azolla filiculoides. To evaluate contributions by further microorganisms, the A. filiculoides microbiome and nitrogen metabolism in bacteria persistently associated with Azolla ferns were characterized. A metagenomic approach was taken complemented by nitrogen isotope determinations of fern biomass and detection of N2O released. Ribosomal RNA genes in sequenced DNA of natural ferns, their enriched leaf pockets and water filtrate from the surrounding ditch established that bacteria of A. filiculoides differed entirely from surrounding water and revealed species of the order Rhizobiales. Analyses of seven cultivated Azolla species confirmed persistent association with Rhizobiales. Two distinct near full-length Rhizobiales genomes were identified from leaf-pocket enriched samples from ditch grown A. filiculoides. Annotation revealed genes for denitrification but not N2-fixation. 15N2 incorporation was active in ferns with N. azollae but not in ferns without. N2O was not detectably released from surface sterilized ferns with the Rhizobiales. N2-fixing N. azollae, we conclude, dominated the microbiome of Azolla ferns. The persistent but less abundant heterotrophic Rhizobiales bacteria possibly contributed to lowering O2 levels in leaf pockets but did not release detectable amounts of the strong greenhouse gas N2O.

Here we present MetaTrans, an efficient open-source pipeline to analyze the structure and functions of active microbial communities using the power of multi-threading computers. The pipeline isdesigned to perform two types of RNA-Seq analyses: taxonomic and gene expression. It performs quality-control assessment, rRNA removal, and differential gene expression analysis and also maps reads against functional databases. Its efficacy was validated with data obtained from a previous study and from sequences that we generated from eighthuman fecal samples collected before and after a flatulogenic diet challenge. Metatrans is written in the closest language to the operating system in order to be able to easily include third-party tools in each of its stages.	SRR3066016

Metagenomic, PCR-DGGE and faecal short chain fatty acids analyses were performed on faecal samples obtained from three infants before and after the administration of each dose of vaccine. We found a high inter-individual variability in the early lifegut microbiota at microbial composition level, but a large similarity between the infantsâ€™ microbiomes at functional level. Rotavirus vaccination did not show any major effects upon the infant gut microbiota. Thus, the individual microbiome establishment and development process seems to occur in a defined manner during the first stages of life and it is not affected by oral rotavirus vaccination.

ERP008443	Characterizing the association of diazotrophic Burkholderia australis with sugarcane	Plant association with bacteria able to fix atmospheric nitrogen (diazotrophs) is a topic of high importance in agriculture due to its potential to reduce cost and environmental pollutions linked to the excessive use of inorganic N fertilizers. Although symbiosis in legumes is well characterized and understood, the association of diazotrophs with non-legumes represent a relatively new topic of research and is much less understood. Here, we characterize the native association occurring between Australian sugarcane variety Q208A and diazotroph Burkholderia australis which promotes sugarcane growth through Biological Nitrogen Fixation. We focused here on physiological mechanisms involved in this interaction and reveal essential new aspects on the functionality of plant-diazotroph association. Our discoveries represent an entry point for a more deep characterization of general non-legume-diazotrophs association, a system presumably highly elaborated.	ERR655088,ERR655089,ERR655090

ERP003612	Richness of human gut microbiome correlates with metabolic markers	We are facing a global metabolic health crisis provoked by an obesity epidemic. Here we report the human gut microbial composition in a population sample of 123 non-obese and 169 obese Danish individuals. We find two groups of individuals that differ by the number of gut microbial genes and thus gut bacterial richness. They harbour known and previously unknown bacterial species at different proportions; individuals with a low bacterial richness (23% of the population) are characterized by more marked overall adiposity, insulin resistance and dyslipidaemia and a more pronounced inflammatory phenotype when compared with high bacterial richness individuals. The obese individuals among the former also gain more weight over time. Only a few bacterial species are sufficient to distinguish between individuals with high and low bacterial richness, and even between lean and obese. Our classifications based on variation in the gut microbiome identify subsets of individuals in the general white adult population who may be at increased risk of progressing to adiposity-associated co-morbidities.

SRP056480	Metagenome sequencing of the Hadza hunter-gatherer gut microbiota.	By human microbiome sequencing we can better understand how host evolutionary and ontogenetic history is reflected in the microbial function. However, there has been no information on the gut metagenome configuration in hunter-gatherer populations, posing a gap in our knowledge of gut microbiota (GM)-host mutualism arising from a lifestyle that describes over 90% of human evolutionary history. Here, we present the first metagenomic analysis of GM from Hadza hunter-gatherers of Tanzania, showing a unique enrichment in metabolic pathways that align with the dietary and environmental factors characteristic of their foraging lifestyle. We found that the Hadza GM is adapted for broad spectrum carbohydrate metabolism, reflecting the complex polysaccharides in their diet. Furthermore, the Hadza GM is equipped for branched-chain amino acid degradation and aromatic amino acid biosynthesis. Resistome functionality demonstrates the existence of antibiotic resistance genes in a population with little to no antibiotic exposure, indicating the ubiquitous presence of environmentally derived resistances. Our results demonstrate how the functional specificity of the GM correlates with environment and lifestyle, and how complexity from the exogenous environment is matched by endogenous homeostasis. The Hadza gut metagenome structure allows to appreciate the co-adaptive functional role of the GM in complementing the human physiology, providing a better understanding of the versatility of human life and subsistence.

But while the biochemical outlines of this feat are known, how a microbial ecosystem can be both efficient and flexible enough to maintain this adaptation is not well understood. Here we move beyond taxonomic approaches to microbial ecology and consider the enzymes present in these environments. We shotgun sequenced two rumen metagenomic samples, obtaining more than 60 million sequence reads. Comparing those reads to a database of more than half a million enzymes allowed us to identify 1.2 million distinct enzyme-coding genes in the samples. We then used a novel metabolic network bi-partitioning approach to link the identified enzymes to the hostâ€™s metabolism.	SRR2145287,SRR2145659

ERP020636	Ancestry, demography, and descendants of Iron Age nomads of the Eurasian Steppe	During the 1st millennium before the Common Era (BCE), nomadic tribes associated with the Iron Age Scythian culture spread over the Eurasian Steppe, covering a territory of more than 3,500km in breadth. To understand the demographic processes behind the spread of the Scythian culture, we analysed genomic data from 8 individuals and a mitochondrial dataset of 96 individuals originating in eastern and western parts of the Eurasian Steppe. Genomic inference reveals that Scythians in the east and the west of the steppe zone can best be described as a mixture of Yamnaya-related ancestry and an East Asian component. Demographic modelling suggests independent origins for eastern and western groups with ongoing gene-flow between them, plausibly explaining the striking uniformity of their material culture. We also find evidence that significant gene-flow from east to west Eurasia must have occurred early during the Iron Age.

ERP005831	Stable isotope probing/metagenomics of terrestrial dimethylsulfide degrading microorganisms	Dimethylsulfide (DMS), a volatile sulfur compound, plays an important role in the global sulfur cycle and atmospheric chemistry. Microorganisms can use DMS as sole carbon, sulfur or energy source, contributing to the cycling of DMS in a wide variety of ecosystems. The diversity of microbial populations degrading DMS in terrestrial environments is poorly understood. Based on cultivation studies, it has been recognised that a wide range of bacteria isolated from terrestrial ecosystems are able to degrade DMS, yet it remains unknown whether any of these play important roles in situ. In this study we identified bacteria using DMS as a carbon and energy source in terrestrial environments, an agricultural soil and a lake sediment, by DNA stable isotope probing (SIP). Microbial communities involved in DMS degradation were analysed by high-throughput sequencing of SIP gradient fractions and metagenomic sequencing of phi29-amplified community DNA.

SRP075634	viral metagenomic analysis of male and female blacklegged tick Ixodes scapularis	The blacklegged tick Ixodes scapularis is widely distributed in the United States and transmits multiple pathogens to humans, wildlife and domestic animalsWe used metagenomic sequencing to investigate the distribution of viruses infecting male and female I. scapularis ticks collected in Centre County, Pennsylvania. Our data highlights the importance of examining all potential avenues of pathogen maintenance and transmission throughout the vector-pathogen life cycle in order to understand the epidemiology of tick-borne pathogens.

ERP013434	Metagenomes and metatranscriptomes from the diffuse hydrothermal vents of Axial Seamount from 2014	This projects explores the functional diversity and activity of rocky subseafloor microbial communities in hydrothermal vent systems. Samples were collected in 2014 from three low temperature diffuse fluid vents at Axial seamount, located in the northeast Pacific Ocean. We also collected a sample using a CTD within the Axial Caldera, at 1200m depth. Shotgun metagenomics and metatranscriptomics were performed on four diffuse vent samples. This study helps to determine the genetic potential and expression patterns of the largely uncharacterized subseafloor microbial community and shows how these patterns change across the complicated biogeochemical gradients of hydrothermal vent systems.

ERP005534	Potential of fecal microbiota for early stage detection of colorectal cancer	Several bacterial species have been implicated in the development of colorectal carcinoma (CRC), but CRC-associated changes of fecal microbiota and their potential for cancer screening remain to be explored. Here we used metagenomic sequencing of fecal samples to identify taxonomic markers that distinguished CRC patients from tumor-free controls in a study population of 156 participants. Accuracy of metagenomic CRC detection was similar to the standard fecal occult blood test (FOBT) and when both approaches were combined, sensitivity improved >45% relative to the FOBT while maintaining its specificity. Accuracy of metagenomic CRC detection did not differ significantly between early and late-stage cancer and could be validated in independent patient and control populations (N=335) from different countries. CRC-associated changes in the fecal microbiome at least partially reflected microbial community composition at the tumor itself, indicating that observed gene pool differences may reveal tumor-related host-microbe interactions. Indeed, we deduced a metabolic shift from fiber degradation in controls to utilization of host carbohydrates and amino acids in CRC patients accompanied by an increase of lipopolysaccharide metabolism.

ERP024173	Mycoses in patients with septic shock	Fungi are of increasing importance in sepsis. However, culture-based diagnostic procedures are associated with relevant weaknesses. Therefore, culture- and NGS-based fungal findings as well as corresponding plasma levels of BG, INF-?, TNF-a, IL-2, -4, -6, -10, -17A and MR-proADM were evaluated in 50 septic patients at 6 consecutive time points within 28 days after sepsis onset. Moreover, immune-response patterns during infections with Candida spp. were studied in a reconstituted human epithelium model. In total, 22% (n=11) of patients suffered from a fungal infection. A NGS-based diagnostic approach appeared to be suitable for the identification of fungal pathogens in patients suffering from fungemia as well as in patients with negative blood cultures. Moreover, MR-proADM and IL-17A in plasma proved suitable for the identification of patients with a fungal infection. Using RNA-seq., adrenomedullin (ADM) was shown to be a target gene, which is upregulated early after an epithelial infection with Candida spp.. In summary, a NGS-based diagnostic approach is able to close the diagnostic gap of routinely used culture-based diagnostic procedures, which can be further facilitated by plasmatic measurements of IL-17A as well as MR-proADM. Moreover, ADM was identified as an early target gene in response to epithelial infections with Candida spp..

SRP103289	Clinical metagenomics of bone and joint infections	Bone and joint infections (BJI) are severe infections that require a tailored and protracted antibiotic treatment. Yet, the diagnostic based on culturing samples lacks sensitivity, especially for hardly culturable bacteria. Metagenomic sequencing could potentially address those limitations. Here, we assessed the performances of metagenomic sequencing of 24 BJI samples for the identification of pathogens and the prediction of antibiotic susceptibility. For monomicrobial samples in culture (n=8), the presence of the pathogen was confirmed by metagenomics in all cases. For polymicrobial samples (n=16), 32/55 bacteria (58.2%) were found at the species level (and 41/55 [74.5%] at the genus level). Conversely, 273 bacteria not found in culture were identified, 182 being possible pathogens and 91 contaminants. A correct antibiotic susceptibility could be inferred in 94.1% and 76.5% cases for monomicrobial and polymicrobial samples, respectively. Altogether, we found that clinical metagenomics applied to BJI samples is a potential tool to support conventional culture.

SRP044326	Freshwater habitats river Metagenome	The Amazon region has the largest hydrographic basin on the planet, the one that includes Amazon River. Besides, it shows a great biological diversity, including related to microorganisms, however, they are poorly studied. The microorganisms are responsible for most of the biogeochemical cycles that determine the terrestrial environment and the freshwater and marine ecosystems, and they can be largely explored in biotechnology. In this work it was used DNA extracted from SolimÃµes riverâ€™s filtered water, to study the microbial diversity, using metagenomics approaches.

SRP092594	Enrichment dynamics of Listeria monocytogenes and the associated microbiome from naturally contaminated ice cream linked to a listeriosis outbreak	Microbiota that co-enrich during efforts to recover pathogens from foodborne outbreaks interfere with efficient detection and recovery. Here, efficiency and dynamics of co-enriching microbiota during recovery of Listeria monocytogenes from naturally contaminated ice cream samples linked to an outbreak are examined using three methods: 1) 48 hour enrichment in buffered Listeria enrichment broth (BLEB); 2) 24 hour enrichment in Half-Fraser broth (HFB), followed by 24 hour in Fraser broth (FB); and 3) 24 hour enrichment in University of Vermont modified broth (UVM) followed by 24 hour in FB. Samples were evaluated at four-hour intervals over a 48-hour enrichment process using DNA extraction and sequencing for each time-point. Resphera Insight and CosmosID analysis tools were employed for high-resolution profiling of 16S rRNA amplicon and whole genome shotgun datasets, respectively.

SRP007153	Gut microbiome of obese mouse 1	Comparisons of the distal gut microbiota of genetically obese mice and their lean littermates, as well as those of obese and lean human volunteers have revealed that obesity is associated with changes in the relative abundance of the two dominant bacterial divisions, the Bacteroidetes and the Firmicutes. We have performed comparative metagenomic analyses to examine how that these changes affect the metabolic potential of the mouse gut microbiome. DNA was isolated from the distal gut (ceca) of eight-week old C57BL/6J obese (ob/ob) and lean (ob/+ and +/+) mice using a bead beater to mechanically disrupt cells, followed by phenol-chloroform extraction. 3730xl capillary- and GS20 pyro-sequencers were used to generate 199.8Mb of community DNA sequence. Finally, the cecal microbiota of C57BL/6J ob/ob and +/+ donors were transplanted into 8-9-week-old germ-free +/+ C57BL/6J recipients for 14 days. Cecal bacterial community structure was compared in donors and recipients by 16S-rRNA-gene-sequence-based enumeration.  DNA sequencing for obese mouse 1 (ob/ob) was performed using 3730xl capillary- and  GS20 pyro-sequencers. Capillary-sequencing-derived contigs (PCAP) and all high quality capillary-sequencing reads are available. 16S rRNA sequences are included in GenBank Accession Numbers  <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?holding=&db=Nucleotide&cmd=search&term=EF095962:EF100118[accn]">EF095962-EF100118. </a>   The WGS project and sequences deposited into the Trace Archive can be found using the Project data link.

ERP020506	Functional potential of the airway microbiome for predicting wheezing phenotype in preschool children	Microbial colonization of the airway may play a role in the pathogenesis of asthma; however, no study has examined the effect of the airway microbiome on childhood asthma or its prognosis. Here, we analyzed the airway microbiota to identify biomarkers that predict the phenotypes associated with preschool wheezing. Nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected from children enrolled in the KOREA (I) study, and high-throughput sequencing was used to examine the structure and functional dynamics of the airway microbiome with respect to asthma phenotypes. The microbiome of children in the asthma and remission groups was more diverse than that of the control group. Proteobacteria were predominant in all groups; however, the proportion of this phylum was lower in the asthma and remission groups. By contrast, the proportion of Firmicutes was highest in the asthma group, whereas that of Fusobacteria was highest in the remission group. The relative abundance of Firmicutes was negatively associated with methacholine PC20 levels (P = 0.014), that of Streptococcus was significantly and negatively associated with FEV1 % predicted (P = 0.023), and that of Staphylococcus was negatively associated with methacholine PC20 (P = 0.013). Arachidonic acid metabolites, lysine residues, and glycosaminoglycans produced by the microbiome were associated with airway inflammation. Differences in profiles of functional genes among the three groups resulted from different microbiome compositions. Thus, alterations in the airway microbiome may affect the prognosis of preschool wheezing phenotypes. Therefore, the airway microbiome can be used to develop biomarkers, treatments, and prophylactics for asthma in preschool children.

ERP011118	Arsenophonus and Sodalis Symbionts in Louse Flies: an Analogy to the Wigglesworthia and Sodalis System in Tsetse Flies	Symbiosis between insects and bacteria result in a variety of arrangements, genomic modifications, and metabolic interconnections. Here, we present genomic, phylogenetic, and morphological characteristics of a symbiotic system associated with Melophagus ovinus, a member of the blood-feeding family Hippoboscidae. The system comprises four unrelated bacteria representing different stages in symbiosis evolution, from typical obligate mutualists inhabiting bacteriomes to freely associated commensals and parasites. Interestingly, the whole system provides a remarkable analogy to the association between Glossina and its symbiotic bacteria. In both, the symbiotic systems are composed of an obligate symbiont and two facultative intracellular associates, Sodalis and Wolbachia. In addition, extracellular Bartonella resides in the gut of Melophagus. However, the phylogenetic origins of the two obligate mutualist symbionts differ. In Glossina, the mutualistic Wigglesworthia appears to be a relatively isolated symbiotic lineage, whereas in Melophagus, the obligate symbiont originated within the widely distributed Arsenophonus cluster. Although phylogenetically distant, the two obligate symbionts display several remarkably similar traits (e.g., transmission via the hostâ€™s â€œmilk glandsâ€ or similar pattern of genome reduction). To obtain better insight into the biology and possible role of the M. ovinus obligate symbiont, â€œCandidatus Arsenophonus melophagi,â€ we performed several comparisons of its gene content based on assignments of the Cluster of Orthologous Genes (COG). Using this criterion, we show that within a set of 44 primary and secondary symbionts, â€œCa. Arsenophonusâ€ is most similar to Wigglesworthia. On the other hand, these two bacteria also display interesting differences, such as absence of flagellar genes in Arsenophonus and their presence in Wigglesworthia. This finding implies that a flagellum is not essential for bacterial transmission via milk glands.	ERR969522

ERP015814	Microbial biogeography of grapes predicts regional metabolite patterns in wine	Microbial activity is an inherent feature of wine production. The microbial communities of grapes present regionally defined patterns, influenced by vineyard and climatic conditions. However, the degree to which these microbial patterns associate with the chemico-sensory qualities of wine is unclear. We demonstrate that both grape microbiota and wine metabolite profiles distinguish growing sub-regions and individual vineyards within Napa and Sonoma County, California. The bacterial and fungal consortia of wine fermentations, composed from vineyard and winery sources, correlate closely with the chemical composition of the finished wines. Grape must microbiota serve as highly accurate biomarkers for predicting metabolite abundance in finished wines using machine-learning models. The use of pre-harvest microbiota as an early predictor of wine qualities is unprecedented and poses a new paradigm for quality control of agricultural products. These findings add further evidence that microbial activity is a definable feature that quantitatively contributes to wine terroir.

ERP015657	Metagenomic characterization of three Swedish sewage treatment plants	Sewage treatment plants (STPs) have repeatedly been suggested as â€œhotspotsâ€ for the emergence and dissemination of antibiotic-resistant pathogens. A critical question still unanswered is if selection pressures within STPs, caused by residual antibiotics or other co-selective agents, are sufficient to specifically promote resistance. To address this, we employed shotgun metagenomic sequencing of samples from different steps of the treatment process in three Swedish STPs. In parallel, concentrations of selected antibiotics, biocides and metals were analyzed.

SRP040544	Environmental Soil Sample	Increasing permafrost thaw, driven by climate change, has the potential to result in organic carbon stores being mineralized into carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) through microbial activity. This study examines the effect of increasing temperature on community structure and metabolic activity of methanogens from the Canadian High Arctic, in an attempt to predict how warming will affect microbially controlled CH4 soil flux. Permafrost and active layer soil samples were collected at the same sites and incubated under anaerobic conditions at warmer temperatures, with and without substrate amendment. Pyrosequencing was used to examine the effects of an extended thaw cycle on methanogen diversity and the results indicate that in situ methanogen diversity, based on the relative abundance of the 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) gene associated with known methanogens, is higher in the permafrost than in the active layer. Methanogen diversity was also shown to increase in both the active layer and permafrost soil after an extended thaw.

SRP016523	Synthetic microbial community partial 16S rRNA amplicons and metagenomes from synthetic microbial community	Next generation sequencing has dramatically changed the landscape of microbial ecology, large scale and in depth diversity studies being now widely accessible. Determining the accuracy of taxonomic and quantitative inferences and comparing results obtained with different approaches are complicated by incongruence of experimental and computational data types and by lack of knowledge of the true ecological diversity. Here we used highly diverse bacterial and archaeal synthetic communities assembled from pure genomic DNAs to compare inferences from metagenomic and SSU rRNA amplicon sequencing. Both Illumina and 454 metagenomic data outperformed amplicon sequencing in quantifying the community diversity but the outcome was dependent on analysis parameters and platform. New approaches in processing and classifying amplicons can reconstruct the taxonomic composition of the community, but all tested primers lead to significant taxon-specific biases. Controlled synthetic communities assembled to broadly mimic the phylogenetic richness in target environments can provide important validation for fine-tuning experimental and computational parameters used to characterize natural communities.

ERP012184	Early Divergent strains of Yersinia pestis in Eurasia five thousands years ago	The bacteria Yersinia pestis is the etiological agent of plague and has in historic times caused human pandemics with millions of deaths. How and when it originated remains contentious. Here, we report the oldest direct evidence of Yersinia pestis identified by ancient DNA in human teeth from Asia and Europe dating from 2,800 to 5,000 years ago. By sequencing the genomes, we find that these ancient plague strains are basal to all known Yersinia pestis. We find the origins of the Yersinia pestis lineage to be at least two times older than previous estimates. We also identify a temporal sequence of genetic changes that lead to increased virulence and the emergence of the Bubonic plague. Our results show that plague infection was endemic in the human populations of Eurasia at least 3,000 years before any historical recordings of pandemics.

SRP002422	The Neonatal Microbiome and Necrotizing Enterocolitis	Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a devastating complication of prematurity. It occurs suddenly, usually during the first month of life, and we don''t know how to prevent it. It is probably more dangerous to premature infants than lung disease today. About one-third of children die and many of the survivors are left with very little intestines. NEC is a disorder that we think might relate to the microbes in the gut. We propose to study this disease intensively, compare cases to controls especially in the days leading up to NEC, and try to determine what differentiates the patients who get this disorder from those who don''t. We might then be able to alter these factors, and prevent this abdominal catastrophe from occurring.

ERP004605	An integrated catalog of reference genes in the human gut microbiome	The gut microbiota is key to human health and disease. Metagenome-wide association studies (MGWAS) that search for disease markers in the gut microbiota, species identification according to metagenomic linkage groups (MLGs) or metagenomic clusters (MGCs), and metatranscriptomics or metaproteomics studies, all depend on a reference gene catalog, which has only been available for individual cohorts or based on reference genome or protein sequences. Here we report a high-quality integrated reference gene catalog consisting 9,879,896 genes, using 6.4 TB sequencing data derived from 1267 published and unpublished human gut metagenomes from three continents. The catalog represents a comprehensive collection of common and rare species, genes and genetic variants, and suggests individuality in the human gut microbiota. Analyses of a group of Chinese and Danish samples using the catalog revealed country-specific signatures in nutrient and xenobiotic metabolism. Our data suggest that interventions on nutrition, pollution and epidemiology should be tailored to the gut microbiota of a given population or even personalized for an individual.

SRP052076	Coral bacterial communities Targeted Locus (Loci)	The response of corals to warm temperature anomalies includes changes in coral bacterial assemblages. There are clear differences between the microbiota of bleached and healthy corals. However, few studies have tracked the microbiota of individual colonies throughout a warming event. We used 454 pyrosequencing and repeated measures to characterize bacterial assemblages in 15 Gorgonia ventalina colonies before, during, four months after, and one year after the 2010 Caribbean warm thermal anomaly. In the latter three sampling times, the G. ventalina microbiota differed significantly from the microbiota of Orbicella faveolata colonies, which were sampled only at these three times. O. faveolata microbiota did not exhibit coordinated shifts through time. Notably, the microbiota of the repeatedly sampled G. ventalina colonies shifted persistently from before to during, after, and long after the warming event. The same pattern emerges from the norm of reaction for the individual G. ventalina colonies. This is the first study to show persistent shifts in coral microbiota in association with a warm thermal anomaly. Whether shifting microbiota is adaptive or maladaptive, the lasting change in bacterial assemblages following this warming event identifies a new way that coral microbiota shape the response of coral colonies under thermal stress.

SRP002078	Antibiotic-contaminated effluent promotes mobile resistance in environmental bacterial communities	The high and sometimes inappropriate use of antibiotics has accelerated the development of antibiotic resistance, creating a major challenge for the sustainable treatment of infections world-wide. Bacteria often respond to antibiotic selection pressure by acquiring resistance genes, i.e. mobile genetic elements that can be shared horizontally between species. Environmental microbial communities maintain diverse collections of resistance genes, which can be mobilized into pathogenic bacteria. Recently, exceptional environmental releases of antibiotics have been documented, but the effects on the promotion of resistance genes and the potential for horizontal gene transfer have yet received little attention. Using metagenomic sequencing we here show high levels of multiple classes of resistance genes in river sediments exposed to waste water from the production of antibiotics in India. Our analysis also revealed a high prevalence of integrons, transposons and plasmids, further emphasizing the risks for horizontal gene transfer. The results suggest that antibiotic contamination may play a role in the promotion of resistance genes and their mobilization from environmental microbes to other species and eventually to clinically relevant bacteria. The entire life-cycle of antibiotic substances, both before, under and after usage, should therefore be considered to fully evaluate their role in the promotion of resistance.

ERP010634	Metaproteomics of aquatic microbial communities in a deep and stratified estuary	Here we harnessed the power of metaproteomics to assess the metabolic diversity and function of stratified aquatic microbial communities in the deep and expansive Lower St. Lawrence Estuary, located in Eastern Canada. Vertical profiling of the microbial communities through the stratified water column revealed differences in metabolic lifestyles and in carbon and nitrogen processing pathways. In productive surface waters, we identified heterotrophic populations involved in the processing of high and low molecular weight organic matter from both terrestrial (e.g. cellulose and xylose) and marine (e.g. organic compatible osmolytes) sources. In the less productive deep waters, chemosynthetic production coupled to nitrification by MG-I Thaumarchaeota and Nitrospina appeared to be a dominant metabolic strategy. Similar to other studies of the coastal ocean, we identified methanol oxidation proteins originating from the common OM43 marine clade. However, we also identified a novel lineage of methanol-oxidizers specifically in the particle rich bottom (i.e. nepheloid) layer. Membrane transport proteins assigned to the uncultivated MG-II Euryarchaeota were also specifically detected in the nepheloid layer. In total, these results revealed strong vertical structure of microbial taxa and metabolic activities, as well as the presence of specific â€œnepheloidâ€ taxa that may contribute significantly to coastal ocean nutrient cycling.

ERP008729	Gut microbiome development along the colorectal adenoma-carcinoma sequence	Colorectal cancer, a commonly diagnosed cancer in the elderly, often develops slowly from benign polyps called adenoma. The gut microbiota, with its critical roles in nutrient metabolism and immune modulation, is believed to be directly involved in colorectal carcinogenesis. The identity and functional capacity of the adenoma- or carcinoma-related gut microbe(s), however, have not been surveyed in a comprehensive manner. Here we perform metagenomewide association study (MGWAS) on stools from healthy controls, advanced adenoma and carcinoma patients, revealing gene markers from over 100 bacterial strains enriched in each group.

ERP022794	We analyzed 9,933 larvae from 383 samples in the Gulf of Aqaba collected during 2010-2011 stratified over sites, depth and seasons and analyzed their metagenome using NGS technology.	The global deterioration of coral reefs is fueling considerable reef monitoring and conservation efforts worldwide. A major focus of these efforts is the larval pool of reef fish, which is crucial to population replenishment and dispersal in the coral reef. However, species-level community-wide monitoring of reef fish larvae was so far impractical due to the high morphological identity between larvae of different species. Here we used barcode-based, amplification-free, high throughput metagenomics to study larval ecology in the Gulf of Aqaba, a habitat that includes >1.5% of all world fish species. We analyzed 9,933 larvae from 383 samples collected during 2010-2011 stratified over sites, depth and seasons. Metagenomic DNA extracted from pooled larvae was matched to a database of genomic barcodes compiled for 77% of adult reef fish in the region. This yielded species-level, quantitative reconstruction of the larval community, allowing species abundance estimation. We documented spatio-temporal preferences of larvae of multiple species, and found significant correlations between the abundance of adults and their larvae, suggesting that larval supply plays a major role in determining local adult densities. We also documented larval flux of species whose adults were never sighted in the region, suggesting recruitment barriers as the major cause for adult absence. Our data also suggest larvae as a dispersal mode for Lessepsian migration of Indo-Pacific species into the Mediterranean.

ERP009498	Forest harvesting reduces the soil metagenomic potential for biomass decomposition	Soil is the key resource that must be managed to ensure sustainable forest productivity. Soil microbial communities mediate numerous essential ecosystem functions, and recent studies show that forest harvesting alters soil community composition. From a long-term soil productivity study site in a temperate coniferous forest in British Columbia, 21 forest soil shotgun metagenomes were generated, totaling 187 Gb. A method to analyze unassembled metagenome reads from the complex community was optimized and validated. The subsequent metagenome analysis revealed that, 12 years after forest harvesting, there were 16% and 8% reductions in relative abundances of biomass decomposition genes in the organic and mineral soil layers, respectively. Organic and mineral soil layers differed markedly in genetic potential for biomass degradation, with the organic layer having greater potential and being more strongly impacted by harvesting. Gene families were disproportionately affected, and we identified 41 gene families consistently affected by harvesting, including families involved in lignin, cellulose, hemicellulose, and pectin degradation. The results strongly suggest that harvesting profoundly altered below-ground cycling of carbon and other nutrients at this site, with potentially important consequences for forest regeneration. Thus, it is important to determine whether these changes foreshadow long-term changes in forest productivity or resilience and whether these changes are broadly characteristic of harvested forests.

SRP097780	salt mine metagenome Metagenome	We will address the question of how carbon is used in deep subsurface hypersaline microbial communities associated with deep Permian evaporate deposits. Our work involves examining brine seeps present in a UK salt mine (Boulby Mine). Here, we are able to utilize the vast area exposed by the mine roadway network (>1000km) to give us unprecedented access to the deep subsurface. Using this substantial area allows us not only to examine carbon usage in localized areas of the environment, but over extensive regions of the evaporite deposit. Consequently, this project provides a novel opportunity to ask questions about the biogeographical patterns present within a deep subsurface environment. Metagenomic sequencing is a vital to achieving these goals. The two key questions we aim to answer with this sequencing work are therefore:What is the primary source of carbon for microbial communities living in a deep subsurface evaporite? andDo the metabolic and carbon usage capabilities of these microbial communities vary spatially within a deep subsurface evaporite?

ERP011240	Variation in the Microbiota of Ixodes ticks with geography, species and sex	Ixodes scapularis is the principle vector of Lyme disease in the East coast and upper Midwest regions of the United States, yet the tick is also present in the Southeast, where Lyme disease is absent or rare. A closely related species, I. affinis also carries the pathogen in the South but does not seem to transmit to humans. In order to better understand the geographic diversity of the tick, we analyzed the microbiota of 104 adult I. scapularis and 13 adult I. affinis ticks captured in 19 locations in South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, Connecticut and New York. Initially ticks from 4 sites were analyzed by 454-pyrosequencing. Subsequently, ticks from these sites plus 15 others were analyzed by Illumina MiSeq. By both analyses female tick microbiomes were significantly less diverse than those of male ticks. The dissimilarity between tick microbiomes increased with distance between sites and the state in which a tick was collected could be inferred from its microbiota. The genus Rickettsia was prominent in all locations. Borrelia was also present in most locations, and was especially high in one site in Western Virginia. In contrast, Enterobacteriaceae was very common in North Carolina I. scapularis but uncommon in I. scapularis from other sites or in North Carolina I. affinis. These data suggest substantial variations in the Ixodes microbiota associated with geography, species, and sex.	ERR973959,ERR973962

ERP005307	Microbial Community of Mobilong Acid Sulfate Soil depth profile using Metagenomics	The latter part of the Australian Millenium drought in 2007-2009 caused the acidification of acid sulfate soils in wetland and former floodplain soils, which pose threats to terrestrial and coastal ecosystems even after the recovery of surface flows and ground water levels. Drying and subsequent oxidation of ASS materials caused soil pH to drop to less than 4 (forming sulfuric materials) in some areas, triggering environmental problems such as land degradation, loss of native plants and animals, and release of heavy metals and metalloids into ground water, rivers and wetlands. To understand this microbially-mediated oxidation process, microbial communities were studied within an acidified acid sulfate soil profile, to identify key microorganisms involved in soil acidification. Six soil layers were sampled from a soil profile according to soil morphology at the most acidic location (35Â° 6' 21.15" S, 139Â° 16' 29.18" E) in the field. Total DNA from soil samples was extracted using MO-BIO PowerMaxÂ® Soil DNA Isolation Kit and sequenced by Illumina Miseq (250PE) by The Ramaciotti Centre, NSW, Australia, prepared with a Nextera DNA Sample Preparation Kit. There were five steps of non-specific amplification involved in Nextera-Miseq sequencing for obtaining enough DNA for sequencing.

SRP010272	Targeted metagenome exploration by solution hybridization-selection capture coupled to next-generation sequencing	The shift from traditional methods to next-generation platforms with high throughput and reduced sequencing costs provided faster acquisition of metagenomic data from various ecosystems. But these next-generation methods still remained difficult to apply to microbial ecology because of the extraordinary diversity of microbial communities within the ecosystems. It would be beneficial, therefore, to reduce the sequence complexity of the sample by focusing on individual genomic subsets of interest. We present an innovative method for targeting large sequences from complex metagenomic DNA, enriched in-solution with biotinylated RNA probes and coupled to next generation sequencing. Initially, the method was evaluated in-solution by targeting the methyl Coenzyme M reductase subunit A gene (mcrA) using a genomic DNA library from the methanogen strain Methanosarcina acetivorans C2A, and metagenomic DNA library from a freshwater lake sample. Our method yielded an enrichment performance of at least 175,365-fold with two cycles of capture, and showed the ability to retrieve large DNA sequence that covering and exploring mcrA flanking regions. For high-throughput mcrA gene survey within the freshwater lake metagenome, we also compared our capture method coupled to 454 pyrosequencing with traditional metagenomic random shotgun and PCR-based sequencing approaches. All methods were effective but highest enrichment performance of 49.3 % and 99.9 % were obtained respectively with our capture method and PCR. In contrast, the capture method allowed the efficient recovering of larger DNA sequence with deeper investigation on minority methanogenic phylotypes related to mcrA gene sequence analysis.

ERP015413	Age-related macular degeneration is associated with alterations in the gut microbiome	Age-dependent macular degeneration (AMD) is the most frequent cause of blindness in the elderly. There is evidence that nutrition, inflammation and genetic risk factors play an important role in the development of AMD. Recent studies suggest that the composition of the gut microbiome is associated with metabolic diseases through modulation of inflammation and host metabolism. To investigate whether compositional and functional alterations of the gut microbiome are associated with AMD, we sequenced the gut metagenomes of patients with AMD and controls. The genera Anaerotruncus and Oscillibacter as well as Ruminococcus torques and Eubacterium ventriosum were relatively enriched in patients with AMD, whereas Bacteroides eggerthii was enriched in controls. Patientâ€™s gut microbiomes were enriched in genes of the L-alanine fermentation, glutamate degradation and arginine biosynthesis pathways and decreased in genes of the fatty acid elongation pathway. These findings suggest that alterations in the gut microbiome are associated with AMD and that the interdependency between amino and fatty acid metabolism and AMD could be targeted by microbiome-altering interventions.

SRP034890	Gut Metagenome	Malnutrition is a global health problem affecting more than 300 million children worldwide. It is one of the major health concerns in India since around 50% of children below the age of two suffer from various forms of malnutrition. The gut microbiome, collective genomes of bacteria, fungi, protists and viruses present in the alimentary canal, plays an important role in nutrient pre-processing, assimilation and energy harvest from food. Malnourishment and health can probably be directly linked to dysbiosis and eubiosys states of the gut microbiota composition and function.To investigate the role of the gut microbiome in malnutrition, we studied the gut microbiome of 20 rural Indian children with varying nutritional status. Metagenomics approach was adopted to explore the gut microbiome.	SRR1067674,SRR1067716,SRR1067721,SRR1068216,SRR1068217,SRR1068219,SRR1087910,SRR1087911,SRR1087918

SRP007152	Gut microbiome of lean mouse 1	Comparisons of the distal gut microbiota of genetically obese mice and their lean littermates, as well as those of obese and lean human volunteers have revealed that obesity is associated with changes in the relative abundance of the two dominant bacterial divisions, the Bacteroidetes and the Firmicutes. We have performed comparative metagenomic analyses to examine how that these changes affect the metabolic potential of the mouse gut microbiome. DNA was isolated from the distal gut (ceca) of eight-week old C57BL/6J obese (ob/ob) and lean (ob/+ and +/+) mice using a bead beater to mechanically disrupt cells, followed by phenol-chloroform extraction. 3730xl capillary- and GS20 pyro-sequencers were used to generate 199.8Mb of community DNA sequence. Finally, the cecal microbiota of C57BL/6J ob/ob and +/+ donors were transplanted into 8-9-week-old germ-free +/+ C57BL/6J recipients for 14 days. Cecal bacterial community structure was compared in donors and recipients by 16S-rRNA-gene-sequence-based enumeration.  DNA sequencing for lean mouse 1 (+/+) was performed using 3730xl capillary- and GS20 pyro-sequencers. Capillary-sequencing-derived contigs (PCAP) and all high quality capillary-sequencing reads are available. 16S rRNA sequences are included in GenBank Accession Numbers  <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?holding=&db=Nucleotide&cmd=search&term=EF095962:EF100118[accn]">EF095962-EF100118. </a>  The WGS project and sequences deposited into the Trace Archive can be found using the Project data link.

SRP073617	algae metagenome Raw sequence reads	Light and iron levels control bulk primary productivity in the Southern Ocean but their influence on the niche partitioning by co-occurring taxa in the Southern Ocean remains elusive. We used metatranscriptome analyses of a Ross Sea polynya bloom contributed by multiple phytoplankton species to dissect algal acclimation to light and iron levels. Co-occurring algae had functional expression profiles dictated by taxonomy rather than environmental variations. Despite important functional differences, they shared a similar environmental status (low light and low iron condition) in the bloom and key acclimation responses to light and iron regimes. Yet, the overall environmental transcriptomic responses greatly varied between algae: Pseudo-Nitzschia, Chaetoceros, Proboscia and Phaeocystis responded mostly to iron addition while Thalassiosira and Fragiliariopsis were mostly influenced by light. The differences in acclimation among co-occurring algae (including within diatom species) are inconsistent with phylogenetic distances and challenge the light-centric model of algal niche establishments for this remote ocean. They indicate that iron and light govern not only productivity but also the phytoplankton community composition of this highly productive polynya.

ERP003699	Dietary intervention impact on gut microbial gene richness based on SOLiD next generation sequencing technology	Complex gene-environment interactions are considered important in the development of obesity. The composition of the gut microbiota can determine the efficacy of energy harvest from food and changes in dietary composition have been associated with changes in the composition of gut microbial populations. The capacity to explore microbiota composition was dramatically improved by the development of metagenomic approaches, which have already allowed production of the first human gut microbial gene catalogue and stratifying individuals by their gut genomic profile into different enterotypes, but the analyses were carried out mainly in non-intervention settings. To investigate the temporal relationships between food intake, gut microbiota and metabolic and inflammatory phenotypes, we conducted diet-induced weight loss and weight stabilisation interventions in a study sample of 38 obese and 11 overweight individuals. Here we report that individuals with reduced microbial gene richness (40%) present more pronounced dys-metabolism and low-grade inflammation, as observed concomitantly in the accompanying paper. Dietary intervention improves low gene richness and clinical phenotypes, but appears to be less efficient for inflammation variables in individuals with lower gene richness, which thus may have predictive potential for the efficacy of intervention.

The riverâ€™s effect on the ocean depends not only on the river hydrology, but what the river carries and how those components are modified during transit from their terrestrial or aquatic origins. We brought together limnologists and oceanographers in an integrated project to improve our understanding of carbon exchange between the atmosphere and this tropical river continuum, focusing on the lower reach, nearshore, and offshore tropical Atlantic, with the goal of improving predictive capabilities under differing climate change scenarios.

ERP003954	Reconstructing the microbial diversity and function of pre-agricultural tallgrass prairie soils in the United States	Although soil microbes play critical roles in terrestrial ecosystems, factors controlling spatial variability in the diversity and functional capabilities of these communities remain poorly understood. Particular knowledge gaps exist for biomes severely impacted by human activities, including the native tallgrass prairie that once covered >65 million ha of the midwestern United States, but has been nearly eradicated by decades of agricultural practices. Here we have reconstructed the microbial biodiversity that once sustained this highly productive ecosystem by analyzing soils from prairie relicts via shotgun metagenomics and targeted sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. The taxonomic and functional diversity of the microbial communities were well-correlated, demonstrating that these communities are not functionally equivalent as has often been assumed - even small changes in belowground diversity can have important impacts on soil processes. As for many plant and animal communities, we could predict the structure and functional traits of the microbial communities from climatic conditions, allowing us to build predictive maps of soil biodiversity across the historical range of the tallgrass prairie ecosystem. The biogeographical patterns were largely driven by changes in the abundance of Verrucomicrobia, a poorly-studied bacterial phylum that dominated the prairie soils. The shotgun metagenomic data suggest that these spatial patterns were associated with shifts in soil carbon and nitrogen dynamics across the tallgrass prairie ecosystem. We show that we can use metagenomic data to reconstruct the belowground biogeochemical and diversity gradients that once existed, information that could be essential to guiding ongoing efforts to restore the threatened tallgrass prairie ecosystem.

SRP005853	Finding a Needle in the Virus Metagenome Haystack - Micro-Metagenome Analysis Captures a Snapshot of the Diversity of a Bacteriophage Armoire	Viruses are ubiquitous in the oceans and critical components of marine microbial communities, regulating nutrient transfer to higher trophic levels or to the dissolved organic pool through lysis of host cells. Hydrothermal vent systems are oases of biological activity in the deep oceans, for which knowledge of biodiversity and its impact on global ocean biogeochemical cycling is still in its infancy. In order to gain biological insight into viral communities present in hydrothermal vent systems, we developed a method based on deep-sequencing of pulsed field gel electrophoretic bands representing key viral fractions present in seawater within and surrounding a hydrothermal plume derived from Loki's Castle vent field at the Arctic Mid-Ocean Ridge. The reduction in virus community complexity afforded by this novel approach enabled the near-complete reconstruction of a lambda-like phage genome from the virus fraction of the plume. Phylogenetic examination of distinct gene regions in this lambdoid phage genome unveiled diversity at loci encoding superinfection exclusion- and integrase-like proteins. This suggests the importance of fine-tuning lyosgenic conversion as a viral survival strategy, and provides insights into the nature of host-virus and virus-virus interactions, within hydrothermal plumes. By reducing the complexity of the viral community through targeted sequencing of prominent dsDNA viral fractions, this method has selectively mimicked virus dominance approaching that hitherto achieved only through culturing, thus enabling bioinformatic analysis to locate a lambdoid viral â€œneedle" within the greater viral community â€œhaystack". Such targeted analyses have great potential for accelerating the extraction of biological knowledge from diverse and poorly understood environmental viral communities.	SRR101488,SRR654729

SRP002558	Metagenomics detects a minimal disruption in the bovine abomasal microbiota by the parasitic nematode Ostertagia ostertagi in immune animals	Ostertagia ostertagi infections in ruminants result in impaired gastrointestinal function. Partially immune animals were developed after multiple experimental infections. These animals displayed reduced worn burdens and a slightly elevated abomasal pH upon reinfection. In this study, we characterized the abomasal microbiota in response to reinfection using metagenomic tools. Compared to control animals, reinfection did not seem to induce a conspicuous change in microbial community composition. Phylogenetic analysis identified 33 phyla in the bovine abomasal microbiota with Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Fibrobacteres, and Spirochates being the most predominant, in this order. Among the 294 genera identified in the abomasal microbiota, Prevotella, Bacteroides, Fibrobacter, Clostridium and Ruminococcus were the most abundant. Infection did not seem to impact the abomasal microbial diversity at a genus level. Up to 36% of the DNA sequences were unknown, suggesting that a substantial portion of bovine abomasal microbial diversity remained unexplored. Proteins predicted from DNA sequences were assigned to 5,408 Pfam protein families, demonstrating dazzling arrays of functional diversity in bovine abomasal microbial communities. Metagenome plasticity in the abomasum was evident. Sixty nine protein families were significantly impacted by reinfection. Our results demonstrated that immune animals developed abilities to maintain proper stability of their abomasal microbial ecosystem.  A minimal disruption in the bovine abomasal microbiota by reinfection may contribute equally to the restoration of gastric function in immune animals.	SRR054648,SRR054649,SRR054650,SRR054651

SRP108915	Viral and Bacterial Communities of Colorectal Cancer	Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States and is a primary cause of morbidity and mortality throughout the world. Its risk has been linked to changes in colonic bacterial community composition. Viruses are another important component of the colonic microbial community, however they have yet to be studied in colorectal cancer despite their oncogenic potential. We evaluated the colorectal cancer virome (virus community) in stool using a cohort of 90 human subjects with either healthy, adenomatous (precancerous), or cancerous colons. We utilized 16S rRNA gene, whole shotgun metagenomic, and purified virus metagenomic sequencing methods to compare the colorectal cancer virome to the bacterial community. We identified no detectable difference in diversity (alpha or beta) between healthy, adenomatous, or cancerous colonic samples, but more sophisticated random forest models identified striking changes in the virus community. The majority of the cancer-associated virome consisted of temperate bacteriophages, suggesting that the community was indirectly linked to colorectal cancer by modulating bacterial community structure and function. Our data suggested that the influential phages did not exclusively infect influential bacteria, but rather acted through the community as a whole. These results provide foundational evidence that bacteriophage communities are associated with colorectal cancer and likely impact cancer progression by altering the bacterial host communities.

In this study, we used RNA-based stable isotope probing (RNA-SIP) metatranscriptomics to identify the active autotrophic players and genomic pathways present in venting fluids from Axial Seamount, a submarine volcano off the coast of Oregon, USA. Vent fluids for RNA-SIP were collected from a singular vent, Marker 113, and used in shipboard incubations with 13C labeled sodium bicarbonate at 30, 55, and 80ÂºC. Results from RNA-SIP incubations show enrichment of RNA at all three temperatures after 18-36 hours, indicating the presence and activity of subseafloor chemolithoautotrophic microbes in vent fluids. In RNA-SIP experiments across a range of temperatures, both taxonomic and functional diversity was reduced compared to un-manipulated diffuse fluids. At 30ÂºC and 55ÂºC, Epsilonproteobacteria were dominant, oxidizing hydrogen and primarily reducing nitrate. Methanogenic archaea were also present at 55ÂºC, and were the only autotrophs present at 80ÂºC. Correspondingly, the predominant CO2 fixation pathways changed from the reductive TCA cycle to the reductive acetyl-CoA pathway with increasing temperature. This study demonstrates the presence of an active autotrophic subseafloor community across geothermal gradients, lending insight into chemolithoautotrophic communities in the subseafloor at deep-sea hydrothermal vents	ERR908509,ERR908510,ERR908511,ERR908512,ERR908513,ERR908514,ERR908515,ERR908516,ERR908517,ERR908518,ERR908519,ERR908520,ERR908521,ERR908522,ERR908523,ERR908524,ERR908525,ERR908526,ERR908527,ERR908528,ERR908529,ERR908530,ERR908531,ERR908532,ERR908533,ERR908534,ERR908535,ERR908536,ERR908537,ERR908538,ERR908539,ERR908540,ERR908541,ERR908542,ERR908543,ERR908544,ERR908545,ERR908546,ERR908547,ERR908548,ERR908549,ERR908550,ERR908551,ERR908552,ERR908553,ERR908554,ERR908555,ERR908556,ERR908557,ERR908558,ERR908559,ERR908560,ERR908561,ERR908562,ERR908563,ERR908564,ERR908565,ERR908566,ERR908567,ERR908568,ERR908569,ERR908570,ERR908571,ERR908572,ERR908573,ERR908574,ERR908575,ERR908576,ERR908577,ERR908578,ERR908579,ERR908580,ERR908581,ERR908582,ERR908583,ERR908584,ERR908585,ERR908586,ERR908587,ERR908588,ERR908589,ERR908590,ERR908591,ERR908592,ERR908593,ERR908594,ERR908595,ERR908596,ERR908597,ERR908598,ERR908599,ERR908600,ERR908601,ERR908602,ERR908603,ERR908604,ERR908605,ERR908606,ERR908607,ERR908608,ERR908609,ERR908610,ERR908611,ERR908612,ERR908613,ERR908614,ERR908615,ERR908616,ERR908617,ERR908618,ERR908619,ERR908620,ERR908621,ERR908622,ERR908623,ERR908624,ERR908625,ERR908626,ERR908627,ERR908628,ERR908629,ERR908630,ERR908631,ERR908632,ERR908633,ERR908634,ERR908635,ERR908636,ERR908637,ERR908638,ERR908639,ERR908640,ERR908641,ERR908642,ERR908643,ERR908644,ERR908645

ERP012908	Assembly of a 5300-year-old Helicobacter pylori genome from the intestine content of the tyrollean glacier mummy	The stomach bacterium Helicobacter pylori is one of the most prevalent human pathogens. It has dispersed globally with its host for the past 100,000 years leading in a distinct phylogeographic pattern in modern H. pylori populations. This phylogeography is used to deduce both recent and ancient human migrations (1, 2). Owing to the complex demographic history of Europe, different hypotheses about the origin of the extant European H. pylori population (hpEurope) exist (3, 4). Here, we present a 5,300-year-old high-coverage H. pylori genome from a European Copper Age glacier mummy. Comparative sequence analysis with contemporary H. pylori classifies the â€œIcemanâ€ Helicobacter as a cagA positive vacA s1a/i1/m1 type strain, most closely resembling a strain that today is commonly found in Central and South Asia and that substantially shaped the genomes of modern European H. pylori strains.

SRP080963	Metagenomics based spatiotemporal study of Chicago River microbiome	Streams in the urban landscape are highly prone to anthropogenically influenced perturbations which can negatively impact their ecosystem health and water quality. Microbial communities are important ecological components of such streams and their composition and genetic content is also important from a public health perspective. This study aims to understand the spatiotemporal microbial community dynamics in the urban-impacted Chicago River system, with an emphasis on the effects of perturbations such as wastewater treatment plant effluent, combined sewer overflows and stormwater events on the microbial community's taxonomic and functional content. Both whole genome shotgun and 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing techniques were employed for analysis of planktonic and sediment prokaryotic microbial communities.

It is benthic and moderately active. L. nudifrons is expecially abundant along the western Antarctic Peninsula where it plays an ecologically important role as prey to piscivorous fish species (Llompart et al. 2014 and references therein). In this study we characterized for the first time a spleen-specific transcriptome in an Antarctic notothenioid (L. nudifrons) obtained by Illumina sequencing of paired-end normalized library of spleen RNA (cDNA). The data obtained disclosed a broad catalogue of genes expressed in spleen tissue of L. nudifrons, which are involved in several intracellular immune signalling pathways. Future investigations will target the possible correlation between thermal sensitivity and immune response.	ERR793597,ERR793598

Principal component analysis of taxonomic alignments showed some separation between LC+ and LC-, and was not influenced by smoking status. Of the seven bacterial species found in all samples, Streptococcus viridans was significantly higher in LC+ samples. Seven further bacterial species were found only in controls, and 16 were found only in samples from LC+. Additional taxonomic differences were identified in regards to significant fold changes between LC and controls cases, with five species having significantly higher abundances in LC+. Functional differences, evident through significant fold changes, included polyamine metabolism and iron sidrephore receptors. Granulicatella adiacens abundance was correlated with six other bacterial species in LC+ samples only. Further, bacterial species could also be related to LC stage. This study offers a novel insight into the functional capacity and species-level taxonomy of the sputum microbiome LC patients. Furthermore, it suggests G. adiacens as a novel and clinically useful biomarker for LC status and stage.	ERR970359,ERR970360,ERR970361,ERR970362,ERR970363,ERR970364,ERR970366,ERR970368

SRP056641	Human Microbiome Environment Metagenome	The samples within this Bioproject represent the third phase (Phase III) of metagenomic sequencing (whole genome shotgun (WGS) sequencing) of microbial communities from specimens collected as a part of the NIH-supported Human Microbiome Project (HMP Consortium A framework for human microbiome research. Nature. 2012 Jun 13;486(7402):215-21. doi: 10.1038/nature11209). The sample collection represents a unique reference resource of microbiome samples from healthy adults largely residing in the USA at the time of sample collection. In the HMP Phase III component the goal has been to supplement previous WGS sequencing by generating additional sequence from as many of the specimens in the HMP collection as possible that had not been sequenced in the previous HMP Phase I and Phase II sequencing. In Phase III, a focus was placed on six of the 18 body sites: Stool (gut), Buccal mucosa (oral), Supragingival plaque (oral), Tongue dorsum (oral), Anterior nares (nasal), Posterior fornix (vaginal) and the goal was to further capture as many of the longitudinal samples (second and third visits by the same individual) as possible. From genomic DNA extracted from the collected specimens, WGS sequence was produced from libraries constructed from using a NexteraXT library construction protocol. All libraries were sequenced using a 100bp paired end approach using the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform.

SRP090270	soil metagenome Metagenome	Microorganisms have an essential role in earthâ€™s global biogeochemical cycles, and they are able to respond more rapidly than plant communities to environmental changes, which in turn affect ecosystem processes, such as carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling, due to the vastness of microbial biomass and diversity. Therefore, integrating microbial communitiesâ€™ structure and functional variability in forest ecosystem would provide much knowledge on the mechanisms about the nutrition cycles. The objectives of this study were therefore: (1) to determine the patterns of microbial community composition and function shift in forest soil; (2) to unravel how different abiotic factors dominant the dynamics of microbial structure and function over time.

SRP040735	Are abundant bacteria more active than rare bacteria in the Sargasso Sea?	The project will use a combination of pyrosequencing and QPCR approaches to examine rRNA:rDNA ratios, BrdU incorporating cells, and transcript types and amounts in the metatranscriptome of Sargasso Sea surface water. Pyrosequencing (454) avoids amplification and cloning artifacts and it is cost effective. Preliminary analyses indicate that the sequence length of 454 reads and the proposed number of sequences are ideal for addressing the questions raised here. The investigators will also use Micro-FISH to examine incorporation of thymidine, leucine, and PO4. Samples will be collected twice yearly during the spring phytoplankton bloom when heterotrophic bacterial production is lowest and during the peak of bacterial production in summer.

SRP045196	Wastewater metagenome	Wastewater contains a diverse array of toxic compounds that cannot be released directly into the environment.Their degradation is mostly carried out by the activated sludge process either at effluent treatment plants, treating wastewater generated by large-scale industries or Common Effluent Treatment Plants. In order to study the microbial community and metabolic genes associated in such degradative pathways wastewater samples amended with ammonia ,hydroxylamine, nitrate and nitite were subjected to nextgeneration sequencing.
