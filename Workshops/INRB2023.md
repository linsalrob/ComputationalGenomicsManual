# Metagenomics

We are going to jump right in with metagenomics, but [here is a brief introduction](https://linsalrob.github.io/ComputationalGenomicsManual/Metagenomics/) if you want to read something while Rob is talking.



We have created servers for you with all the software and data that you will need for these excercises. 

There are two machines that you can use, if you don't have access to a server:

```
IP Addresses:
1: 115.146.85.154
2: 115.146.84.145
```

# Step 1.

Install `conda`, `fastp`, `minimap2`, `samtools` using [conda](../Conda/)

We will use all of these programs today.
