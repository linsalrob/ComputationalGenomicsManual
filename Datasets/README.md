# Data Sets

We have gathered several data sets for you to use in the course, and in this manual we use different data sets as examples.

The main thing you need to know is whether a data set is a 16S amplicon library or a random community metagenome. 

## Coral and Algae

This is coral, algae, CCA, and water  (control) samples from Kevin Walsh in Liz Dinsdale's lab. 

This is a random community metagenome data set
