# N<sub>50</sub> and N<sub>75</sub>

Two of the essential metrics for assembly are N<sub>50</sub> and N<sub>75</sub>. Both of these are a measure of how long the contigs are. The idea is that you order the contigs from shortest to longest, and find the length of the contig that contains half (for N<sub>50</sub>) or three quarters (for N<sub>75</sub>) of the data. If you have a more complete assembly the numbers should be larger, while with shorter assemblies, these numbers will be less.

There is script called `countfasta.py` that we have provided that takes a single argument and counts the number of fasta characters in the file. (There is a similar metric, called L<sub>50</sub> that reports the number of contigs shorter than the contig that contains the 50% point in sequence length, but no one uses this!).

Example usage of `countfasta.py`:

```bash
countfasta.py -f AlgaeAssembly/contigs.fasta 

Total length: 5426326
Shortest: 57 (NODE_5409_length_57_cov_18.5)
Longest: 47734 (NODE_1_length_47734_cov_9.85858)

N50: 1396 (NODE_1006_length_1396_cov_1.72782)
N75: 2183 (NODE_387_length_2183_cov_1.83224)
```
