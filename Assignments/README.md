# Assignments

This folder contains the assignments for Fall 2018 and associated data. The solutions to the assignments will be posted once the assignment is complete. Of course, once the assignment solution is posted no further attempts will be accepted for an assignment!

All the assignments are posted on the official SDSU CMS (BlackBoard) and that is considered the authoritative site for deadlines, etc. All work must be turned in through Blackboard to receive a grade.
