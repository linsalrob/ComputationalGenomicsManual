# ComputationalGenomicsManual

Robs manual for the computational genomics and bioinformatics class

# About this manual

Rob, Liz Dinsdale, Tom Jeffries, Bruno Gomez-Gil, Jim Mitchell, and several other colleagues and friends have been teaching genomics and metagenomics for a long time. They have written this manual over the course of several years, and in a variety of formats. Rob moved it to markdown using GitHub in Fall 2018 as part of his computational genomics class.

You can view this [manual online](https://linsalrob.github.io/ComputationalGenomicsManual/)

# Companion Videos

Companion videos that accompany this class are available on You Tube on [Rob's YouTube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpPXw4zFa0uLMHwSZ7DMeLGjIUgo1IBbn).

# Workshops.

We are using this content in a [variety of workshops](Workshops/)


# Assignments. 

Solutions are still not shown, but you can work through some of these

* [NCBI EDirect](Assignments/NCBIEDirectAssignment) is to familiarize yourself with NCBI EDirect.
* [Genomics Assignment](Assignments/GenomicsAssignment/) is to analyze complete genomes from *Klebsiella*.
* [Metagenomics Assignment](Assignments/MetagenomicsAssignment) is to analyze some metagenomics data and describe the organisms that you find there.


# Datasets

We have several different [datasets](Datasets/) available for you to use to try the course work out. There are both 16S and random metagenomes, and links to genomics data.


# PDFs

Note: The PDFs are automatically created from the markdown, and loose some of the images and links. You should probably use the HTML version most of the time.

# About Copyright Information
