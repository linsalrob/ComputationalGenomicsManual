# ComputationalGenomicsManual

Robs manual for the computational genomics and bioinformatics class

# About this manual

Rob, Liz Dinsdale, Tom Jeffries, Bruno Gomez-Gil, and several other colleagues and friends have been teaching genomics and metagenomics for a long time. They have written this manual over the course of several years, and in a variety of formats. Rob moved it to markdown using GitHub in Fall 2018 as part of his computational genomics class.

# Assignments. 

At the moment the assignments are live and so solutions are not shown. They will eventually be included so you can work through the examples.

* [Assignment 1](Assignments/Assignment1/) is to familiarize yourself with NCBI EDirect.


Note: The PDFs are automatically created from the markdown, and loose some of the images and links. You should probably use the HTML version most of the time.
